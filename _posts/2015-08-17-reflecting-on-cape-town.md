<h3>Bru, did I have the adventure of a lifetime.</h3>

I <a href="{% post_url 2015-06-28-a-216m-leap-of-faith %}" target="_blank">bungee jumped</a> off a 216 m bridge, and dove in a cage with <a href="{% post_url 2015-06-07-unreal-reality %}" target="_blank">great whites</a>. I pet not one, but two <a href="{% post_url 2015-06-29-garden-route %}" target="_blank">cheetahs</a> simultaneously. I rode an ostrich until I fell off, and an elephant until the sun set. I took selfies with penguins at the end of the world, and got photos taken of me on a sandboard against crystal blue skies and perfect white sand dunes. I was beaten down by countless waves until I stood up on a surfboard, and beat down countless drinks until I couldn't stand. I <a href="{% post_url 2015-08-01-hikes %}" target="_blank">hiked</a> mountains to happen upon lakes, and ran alongside the ocean to get a glimpse of the mountains.

Alongside an awesome teaching staff, I helped 73 students learn how to code in a matter of months, and helped them build beautiful, functional web apps that tackled problems from food waste all the way to education. 

<h3>But Jesus, did I <i>struggle</i> like I have never before.</h3>
There was plenty of social drama the first couple of months, which felt like I was living in a reality TV show, complete with my own plot line.

I had trouble with work, not the work itself, but the conditions I agreed to. I thought about quitting. At times I felt I made the wrong choice deciding to come work for iX, like they had found the wrong person to TA.

My professional life and personal life melded together into this goopy mess, as I lived with, worked with, and partied with the same group of people.

I sometimes felt stuck.

<h3>Some people call struggle by another name. I personally quite like "growth."</h3>

Through it all, I learned about the power of <b>surrounding myself with people who saw me for who I could be, and not for who I necessarily was in the moment</b>. Especially a Zulu Queen, a programmer turned technology educator, and a new coder with a thousand lives. Nothing was more motivating than people by my side genuinely advocating for my success, and weren't afraid to tell me straight when I could do better. 

When I could <i>be</i> better.

I began to think hard about living life the way you <b>choose</b> to live it, and what it means to design your lifestyle. I learned that it starts with just that -- a conscious choice.

<h3>What really made my experience, though, were my students.</h3>

A bunch of <b>strangers</b>, who came from all over the world to be <b>students</b>, who I soon called my <b>friends</b>, who slowly became my <b>family</b>. 

They were the ones who threw me the most badass birthday parties I've ever had, and forced me to live in the moment, if only for a moment. They were the ones who shared their life stories with me, and saw <i>me</i> at my realest, the ones who saw through all sorts of bullshit, and called me out on mine. They were the ones who's passion for what they were doing renewed my passion for what I was doing.

It's not the place I loved and it's not the place I'll miss.

<h3>It's the people I had the opportunity to meet along the way, <i>these people</i>. The ones I came to teach, but who became the ones who taught me the most about myself.</h3>
