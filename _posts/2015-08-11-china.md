<h3 class="section-heading">I'm in China!</h3>

Without even having enough time to process my experience in South Africa, I'm already in Hangzhou, China, a <b>drastically</b> different environment, participating as a mentor in the MIT China Development Initiative Service Leadership Program. More reflections on Cape Town to come soon, but for now, just wanted to share some first thoughts on coming back to the motherland after 7 years away.

<h3>1. The food service here is incredibly fast.</h3>
Ok maybe this is juxtaposed with the service in Cape Town, but it took at least 30 min for a <i>fruit salad</i> to come in South Africa, and takes less than 10 min for hot bowls of noodles to come in China. You decide which one you prefer.

<h3>2. The firewall. That is all.</h3>
Currently unable to access google (WHICH INCLUDES GMAIL) or facebook without a VPN. The result? A frustratingly slow internet connection, gratefulness for the US government, and a first hand understanding as to why China has its own versions of everything (ie Baidu).

<h3>3. The food here really makes me happy.</h3>
See adorable steamed custard buns shaped like piggies below.

Though this is leading to a problem where I eat all the time and am never hungry, because I'm always eating when I'm already full. Today I felt something that resembled hunger for the first time in 3 days. It promptly left as a shoved some soup dumplings into my mouth.

<h3>4. I STILL GOT IT.</h3>
Not gonna lie, I was really nervous about my ability to communicate in Mandarin. Since coming here, have been pleasantly surprised by how much I can say with the vocabulary of maybe a 4th grader. Woo!

<h3>Most of all...</h3>
I really do feel like I'm <b>coming back</b> to China, as if I've left something, a part of me, behind and it's been waiting for me all this time. There's something familiar about the way people behave, about the things that are socially acceptable, about the way people interact with other people, and most of the time, I <b>get</b> it. Even though I'm generally disconnected from a great deal of Chinese culture, I <b>still</b> feel connected to the people here. 

It's even stranger for me to think about a parallel universe in which my parents did not immigrate to Minnesota, one in which I <i>am</i> one of these girls I am mentoring, starry eyed about America, wearing shirts with mismatched English words, eating porridge and watermelon for breakfast and sipping on loose leaf tea instead of my daily cup of coffee.

<h3>One in which this was home, and that's what I was coming back to.</h3>
