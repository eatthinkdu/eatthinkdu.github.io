<h3 class="section-heading">To me, elephants always seemed invincible.</h3>

They're smart. They're adorable. They're massive yet friendly. They're exotic. Everyone, and I mean everyone, can't help but fall in love with them.

It came as a huge shock to me that the majority of elephants in Thailand are actually <i>suffering</i> working in the tourism industry. 
<h3>My day visiting the Elephant Jungle Sanctuary was both a fun, and eye-opening experience.</h3>

After a 2 hour drive and a bit of bumpy off-roading through a jungle in our tuk-tuk red cab, the trees opened up into what I can only describe as <b>elephant paradise</b> - lush green grass, rolling hills, a pile of corn husks, a mud pool, and a waterfall.

I, along with the rest of the group, changed into traditional <i>mahout</i> gear, a colorful rug-like t-shirt we were to wear for the rest of our time at Elephant Jungle Sanctuary, and were given a brief introduction of their mission, and also background on the plight of the Asian Elephant.

<h3>Because of agriculture and human expansion, there is no longer room for the wild Asian elephant.</h3>

Elephants in captivity have <i>mahouts</i>, the name for elephant caretakers, but they sometimes do not give their elephants the best care out of desperation for money or just lack of knowledge.

I'm talking broken or disfigured backs from elephant riding, emotional abuse from a young age, exhaustion from being overworked. They are chained, fenced in, poked and prodded with wooden hooks in order to follow human commands sheerly for the purpose of tourist entertainment. The oldest elephant at Elephant Jungle Sanctuary actually had a crooked back from riding years ago.

Ethically responsible elephant parks, like Elephant Jungle Sanctuary and Elephant Nature Park, take in formerly abused elephants, take care of them, and allow them to roam free within the sanctuaries - without chains, hooks, or riding.

<h3>We still spent the entire day interacting with elephants - but in a way that was safe and enjoyable for both the animals and for visitors.</h3>

We fed the elephants bunches of bananas (they literally do not stop eating and pooping), walked with them around the grounds, played with them in the mud pits, and lastly bathed them in the waterfall.

All of which felt more <b>natural</b> than riding, and allowed you to get close to the massive creatures in a way that seemed <b>comfortable</b>. Seeing how smart, friendly, and hilarious elephants are, so up close and personal was not only an incredible experience.

<h3>It was also a lesson on humanity, on our effect on the creatures around us, and a challenge to look a little deeper when participating in animal tourism.</h3>
