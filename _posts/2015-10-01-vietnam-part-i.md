<h3 class="section-heading">3 weeks. 9 stops.</h3>
I spent the first 10 days mostly in cities, ranging from the non-stop craziness and heat of Saigon, to the peaceful, cooler, alps-like Dalat. My time in south and central Vietnam is characterized mostly by delicious, cheap food, heaps of energy, and a good dose of culture and history.

<h3>Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City)</h3>

<p>First stop in Vietnam, and immediately overwhelmed by the constant, never-stopping flow of mopeds and motorcycles. Something as simple and mundane as crossing the street suddenly became a whole new adventure. The only way to cross a street was to take the first step, walk at a constant velocity straight, and trust that bikes would swerve out of your predicted path. I visited the War Remants Museum, which was gut wrenchingly sad especially as an American. Other than that, I spent most of my time in Saigon walking around the city trying to soak up its hustle bustle energy, eating as much street food as possible.</p>

<h3>Dalat</h3>

<p>What is there not to love about Dalat? When I arrived, the sun was setting, I was alone, and worst of all, quickly realizing I was lost. I wandered into a hotel looking for directions and discovered I was not a 5 minute walking distance from my hostel, but a 50 minute walk away. The older woman I was talking to immediately jumped up to help me, put my stuff on her scooter, and took me to where I was supposed to be without asking for any compensation. Besides <a href="{% post_url 2015-09-06-canyoning-in-dalat %}" target="_blank">canyoning</a>, which is still one of the <a href="{% post_url 2015-09-22-best-of-vietnam %}" target="_blank">highlights</a> of my time in Vietnam, I also went on a motorbike tour of the countryside, learning how silk, coffee, and rice wine are produced. Beautiful views combined with a cooler climate, an adorable family hostel, the best bakery I found in Vietnam, and especially great people makes Dalat my favorite city in southern Vietnam.</p>

<h3>Nha Trang</h3>
<p>Had a 3 hour bus "layover" in this beach town so headed to the only thing there was to see - the beach. Worth mentioning only for the BEST <i>banh xeo</i> I got on a random corner for less than a dollar.</p>

<h3>Hoi An</h3>
After 16 hours on a bus, Hoi An was heaven. Rented a bicycle for the day and biked around the old city, and found my way to the beach. Charming and vintage-looking, with a market right along the river, colorful boats, and walking streets. Most photogenic city ever.

<h3>Hue</h3>
Spent 2 days in Hue, which was more than enough. Highlight was the market, which was packed with good deals, cheap eats, and no tourists in sight. Also visited the DMZ (de-militarized zone) to learn more about the effects of the Vietnam War (or, the "American War" as they call it), and also their perception of America.
