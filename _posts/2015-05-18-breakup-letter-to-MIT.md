<h1>Dear MIT,</h1>

<h3>It’s not you, it’s me.</h3> 
When we first met, I was nothing short of dazzled. I became enamored by the fast pace of living, thinking, and doing. Constantly moving, never stopping, we took on the world. You flew me across nations, introduced me to some of my closest friends, exposed me to my passions, challenged me to beyond what I thought was my breaking point. You kept me on my toes, pushed me out of my comfort zone, and as a result expanded my boundaries, putting what was out of reach in my hands. I tried every and any new experience I could get my hands on: sabar, lacrosse, ceramics, traveling, a sorority, teaching. I was exhausted, overwhelmed.

Sometimes I thought even that wasn’t enough. 

But after 5 years, I’ve grown tired. I’ve grown up. But most of all, I’ve outgrown you. 


<h3>It’s not me, it’s you.</h3>
Were we ever right for each other? You are so so so needy. Demanding. Often unforgiving, even though you’re “working on it.” You have a knack for taking over lives and spirits and breaking them down so far until it’s hard to find the pieces to put back together. And like I’ve always said, you have always had a way of bringing out the absolute best in me, but are exceptionally talented at bringing out the worst.

At the end of the day, I grew to love you. All the quirks, all the flaws, all the inconsistencies. The late nights, the early mornings. And I will miss all of it. Even the parts that hurt the most because those are the parts that have pushed me to grow more than I could have imagined.

<h3>So I guess this is the end.</h3> 
This is the end to an adventure of a lifetime, to an insurmountable number of memories, to the most amount of personal and academic growth I have ever underwent.

<h3>But I guess this is also the beginning.</h3>
The beginning of me, just me, a me without MIT, a time to make my own way, and I’m not looking back.

Because I am so looking forward to what comes next.

<h3>Love always,</h3>
