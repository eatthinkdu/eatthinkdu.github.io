<h3 class="section-heading">When you think about it, hiking is really just walking.</h3>

Walking on something more rugged than concrete, walking through scenery more nature-filled than a concrete jungle. And when you think of it that way, hiking doesn't seem all that special.

But a big part of what draws me to hiking, and I think a lot of other people as well, aside from the beautiful views and being outside, is the types of conversations I always have with other hikers. Something about spending hours of uninterrupted time with a group of people works magic on bringing out genuine conversation.

<h3>Hiking is musing about life and sharing stories -- against a backdrop of mountains, under the pretense of exercise.</h3>

Even though it's "winter," I've been lucky enough to spend a lot of time hiking here in Cape Town, at least 2-3 times a week. It's probably my favorite part of this city. Here are the routes I've done -- grab a friend or two and go!

<h3>Lion's Head</h3>
<h4>Time: 1.5 hr</h4>
<h4>Difficulty: Medium</h4>

Must do hike in Cape Town! Good mix of dirt paths of high incline, steps, rock scrambling, and a short stint ladders/chains. Short enough to go on a lunch break but long enough so it feels like a good workout. Incredible views for a low time investment. Great place to watch the sunset.

Detour off main path near the end of the dirt path to find the caves:

<h3>Table Mountain</h3>
<h4>Time: 2 hr up</h4>
<h4>Difficulty: Medium</h4>

Platteklip Gorge is a straight-forward route up the mountain consisting of only rock steps probably made for mini giants. That being said, you can take the cable car down for ~R100. Highest, and best view from the top in Cape Town in my opinion.

<h3>Skeleton Gorge</h3>
<h4>Time: 4 hr</h4>
<h4>Difficulty: Medium-Hard</h4>

Starts at Kirstenbosch Gardens, aka my favorite place in Cape Town, and then go up steps. After a while, you hit ladders and need to scramble over some waterfalls. At the top, you come across a sandy beach and A LAKE. How is that not the perfect hike? Pro-tip: bring food for a picnic in the gardens or at the top.

<h3>Tranquility Cracks (Twelve Apostles)</h3>
<h4>Time: 5 hr</h4>
<h4>Difficulty: Easy</h4>
More of a nice nature walk with a little bit of climbing than serious hiking. Starts at the Pipe Track right off of Camps Bay, detour off the path into Tranquility Cracks to explore a mini cave, end back where you started in a loop. Beautiful views with low effort.
