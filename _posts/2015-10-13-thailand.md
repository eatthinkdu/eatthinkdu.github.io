<h3 class="section-heading">Compared to Vietnam and Cambodia, Thailand was shockingly easy.</h3>

I almost wish I started my trip here, as a more gentle introduction to the backpacking life. It surprised me how developed cities were, from infrastructure to amenities to home comforts like fast food and 711 and Oreos. Everyone spoke English (and spoke it well), activities were just laid out for travellers, street food was located at the most convenient corners, hostels were basically set up for backpackers to hang out.

<h3>Although significantly more tourist-y, there was so so so much to do in Thailand.</h3> My 18 days in <b>no way</b> did it justice. In the north of Thailand I went wilderness trekking, temple hopped, rode my scooter through valleys of unreal scenery, befriended elephants - not to mention everything was dirt cheap. 

In the south of Thailand I spent days just sipping on young coconuts chillin on postcard worthy beaches, got scuba certified in sky blue waters, watched fire dancers spin at night.

That's not even mentioning Bangkok. And all that is, well, Bangkok.

<h3>What colored my time in Thailand was the group of backpackers I was lucky enough to travel with for part of my trip.</h3>

Over just a couple of days, our group of backpackers from Chiang Mai became a "squad." A squad that made moving from place to place less strange, more welcoming, and always fun. A mini travel family that looked out for each other and stuck together - even when my own travel schedule was off everyone else's by a few days.

Like any family trip, yes, it took forever to mobilize and get places. Deciding on a restaurant was a true mission. But no matter what, in whichever city, we would always make the effort to spend time together. They were the people who could easily bypass the small talk and get straight to the realtalk.

<h3>So here's a shoutout to my #SQUAD. You guys made me think. You guys made me laugh. Stay gold.</h3>
