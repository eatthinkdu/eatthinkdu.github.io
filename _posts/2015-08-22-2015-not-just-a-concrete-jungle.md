<h3 class="section-heading">When I say Hong Kong, do you think of...</h3>

Skyscrapers? A huge global financial center? NYC but with millions more asians and they're all yelling loudly in canto?

Ok yes, all those are true.

<h3>But did you know that a whole other world also exists within hours reach?</h3>

When talk of chillin on a secret beach was thrown out during conversation on Friday, I had no idea what to expect. But I figured I liked the words "secret" and "beach," so any combination of the two <i>had</i> to be good. I soon discovered that "secret" and "hard to get to" usually went hand in hand.

On Saturday, a crew of us headed out of Hong Kong city by uber (but also accessible by metro/bus) for Sai Kung, a port city in the east. After a ~45 min ride, we hopped on a bus at Sai Kung for another 30 minutes to arrive at a trailhead, as the only way to get to the beach was by foot.

It was hot and sweaty as balls, which is less than optimal hiking weather, but thankfully, the hiking ended up being pretty moderate, and the trail was well-shaded.

After a 2 hour hike, we stumbled upon nothing short of paradise.

We headed home around sunset via a different, surprisingly more beautiful hike, which also took around 2 hours.

After a short taxi scare, in which no one had cell service and all taxis were taken, we managed to make friends with a group of canto guys that were also stuck, and hail a taxi...which we then took to the bus stand, only to take a bus to town, only to hail another taxi to get back to the city.

All in all, round trip time was probably 6 hours. Was that more time than we actually spent at the beach? Maybe.

<h3>Totally worth it.</h3>
