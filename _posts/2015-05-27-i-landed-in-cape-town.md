<h3 class="section-heading">I am exhausted.</h3>

Like the type of exhausted where you're not only physically tired, but also drained socially and mentally, enough so that not even sleep or massive amounts of coffee will cut it.

I flew to Cape Town 3 days after frantically turning in my Master's thesis, 2 days after a farewell party to say goodbye to all my friends, 1 day after packing up all my things from 5 years in Boston and shipping said boxes to MN, and a couple of hours after packing my suitcases for my 6 months abroad. I <del>think</del> know I have to be crazy.

Even crazier? The amount of things that have happened in such a short span of time. I don't even have the time or energy to put all my thoughts into words right now. But I landed in Cape Town a week ago...and here's what happened next.
