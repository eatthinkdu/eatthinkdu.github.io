<h3 class="section-heading">I am living an unreal reality, and I'm just waiting to wake up from a dream.</h3>

My boss asked me the other day, "If you could describe your experience here in Cape Town, what would it be?"

<h3>"What is going on, who am I?"</h3>

Things are coming at me a million miles a minute, a different sort of firehose, and I am saying yes to everything. I have no idea who this version of myself is, but she is way crazier than the actual Erica. She is also pretty awesome. Maybe I like it. I can't tell yet. You be the judge -- here's a handful of things I've been able to do while in Cape Town.

<h2 class="secion-heading">Shark Cage Diving</h2>

It's exactly what it sounds like, I got to go diving with Great Whites my first weekend in Cape Town. What no one tells you: you wake up at 4 am in the morning, and then board a boat where 25% of the people will barf multiple times. Another 25% will feel like they could chunder at any given moment but hold back by staring at land or sucking on a lollipop. Go figure. What you probably guessed: it was a f***ing awesome experience. Sharks are beautiful. Not to mention massive. You need to do it. Would not recommend drinking the night before.

<h2 class="secion-heading">Surfing</h2>

Every once in a while, I need an experience that knocks me on the ground so I can get back up again (am I masochistic?). Surfing is exactly that. Literally, exactly that. Even though I've wakeboarded and snow boarded before, surfing kicked my ass, and I loved it. There is nothing cooler than standing up on top of a wave, and then getting sucked back into ocean.

<h2 class="secion-heading">Sandboarding</h2>

I distinctly remember lying on the sand next to a friend, board in hand, thinking out loud, "Does it get any better than this?" Can't decide what was more fun: sandboarding, running around barefoot with new friends, sliding down sand hills, holding on for life on the back of a pick up truck driving around the dunes. Current vote is for the running.

<h2 class="secion-heading">Derica</h2>
Am not going into details, but let's just say weekends in Cape Town have been an experience, and that it turns out I have a split personality that takes some, but not too much, encouraging to emerge.

<h2>This is my new normal.</h2>
