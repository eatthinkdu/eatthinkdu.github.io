<h3 class="section-heading">If you've ever tried to go out to eat with me, you know that I am the worst decider ever.</h3>

It's not that I'm a picky eater. Because I will eat virtually anything and everything in front of me. It's actually the opposite. Whenever I get a menu, I'm completely overwhelmed by all the choices that _could_ potentially make me happy that I get confused about what will make me the _happiest_, and end up taking forever to decide. 

This is usually how a typical dinner goes:
<ol>
  <li>Look at menu</li>
  <li>Freak out at the first thing that looks good</li>
  <li>Look down the page and realize you get the same feeling looking at half the menu</li>
  <li>Enter into life dilemma mode and become extremely focused, debating between at minimum 3 options</li>
  <li>When waiter comes, ask for his or her recommendation</li>
  <li>He or she usually says the wrong thing, completely ignore 2-3 recommendations</li>
  <li>Order something completely different from original choices and recommendations</li>
  <li>Ignore friends' exasperated expressions and feel sense of pride for making a decision</li>
</ol>

<h3>That's kind of why I love food markets.</h3>

You can grab tiny things to eat along the way, and get a little bit of everything. No commitment to a large portion, ability to maximize awesomeness. There are a ton of different food markets all over Cape Town, almost every weekend, some of them weekly, some of them seasonal, some of the for special occasions and festivals. 

This Saturday, I went to <b>Old Biscuit Mill</b> in Woodstock, an artsy neighborhood with chill vibes where hippies, artists, and reggae performers hang. 

<h3>Old Biscuit Mill had some serious eats -- everything from potato latkes to dim sum to ginger shots...</h3>

<h3>So even though I <i>still</i> suck at deciding, at Old Biscuit Mill, indecision isn't so bad.</h3>
