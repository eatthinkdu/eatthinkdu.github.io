<h3 class="section-heading">I generally feel uncomfortable in fancy places.</h3>

Everytime I go somewhere upscale I feel like I need to pack all of me into a tiny little pretty box, tuck all the ends in, smooth out any edges, and top everything off with a perfect, tidy bow. 

In my mind this box is an easter shade of pastel pink. This bow is made of satin and is white, not off-white.

<h3>This past week, I went to afternoon tea at Mount Nelson Hotel.</h3>

Described by Wikipedia as "a social event for the upper classes." Described by me as an afternoon of unlimited finger foods and bite sized desserts.

<h3>And it was actually a <i>ton</i> of fun.</h3>

<h3>I guess there's an air of <i>innocence</i> amongst a group of young 20 somethings sitting at high tea.</h3>

Being excited over saying the word "booking." Getting to use sugar cubes instead of sugar packets. Spilling 1/2 of a teapot of tea on your pants. Dripping jam on my dress and then trying to subtly lick it off.

<h3>I guess there's also an air of <i>privilege</i> amongst a group of young 20 somethings sitting at high tea.</h3>

I left feeling slightly guilty. And it was more than the fact that I literally ate my weight's worth in clotted cream and jam which was probably going to give me both diabetes and heart disease. 

Here in Cape Town, where the disparity in wealth is so great and so starkly obvious, it made me slightly guilty to know that I could easily and happily spend R270 ($25) on a buffet of tea, finger foods, and mini desserts, while right outside the door the homeless begged for R10 (less than $1) worth of bread. I've spent a large portion of my blog talking about the fun things I've been able to do, the incredible views I've been able to see.

<h3>But the reality is that there remain a lot of issues that run deep in Cape Town's veins.</h3>

Unemployment is a big one. Poverty, and especially poverty in the townships, is another. Race seems to play a huge role in both. At the same time, I'm not naive enough to believe that these issues are specific to Cape Town.

From an outsider's perspective, it sometimes feels like these issues are swept under the facade of a hip, beautiful city trying to prove itself, trying to recover from a not-so-distant, painfully bitter past. Because Cape Town is fairly well developed and resembles a scenic European city by the water, it's so <b>easy</b> for tourists to purposefully or accidentally or blissfully ignore the massive disparity in wealth that exists in and around this city. In this country. In this continent. 

<h3>And to be completely honest, as an American just visiting for a few months, I still don't know how to respond.</h3>
