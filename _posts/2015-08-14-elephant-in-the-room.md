<h3 class="section-heading">In Cape Town, I sometimes feel like I've been time warped back to pre-civil rights period America.</h3>

Taken back to a social transition period when women and black people were still in the midst of that transition.

Which, you know, makes sense, since apartheid ended a mere 20 years ago.

I am hyper-aware of my biases from previous experiences, my political correctness and sensitivities, but simultaneously acknowledge my lack of knowledge. I am conflicted between being upset about what I'm seeing in Cape Town, yet realizing these problems are not isolated to just this part of the world. These problems also existed and still exist in America.

<h3>It's the elephant in the room. So let's talk.</h3>

There's a lot of racial separation in Cape Town.

From personal experiences, bars and clubs will often either be all white or all black, and social scenes with races intermingling are few and far between. The wait staff at almost every restaurant will be all black, yet the manager will almost always be white. Same goes for a lot of the other jobs in the service industry -- construction, housework. Poverty, homelessness, and race seem to be so strongly correlated.

There are sizeable regions of the city, like the area near the bus station, an entire market above the train station where there is not a single white person to be seen. Race seems to play into people's sense of security as well, and there seems to be a bit of lingering distrust between pockets of society.

While blatantly labelling or grouping people by race is a touchy issue in America, it's commonly done here. 

<h3>I've felt my own quality of life in Cape Town affected by my race.</h3>

Basic privileges, like being called out on the street or a restaurant, become recognized as just that: privileges.

I've been told "Well, you just don't understand..." and "You see, it's not like that here..." and "That's just the way things are right now..." and "That's not considered racist here..." as explanations.

<h3>And I get that. But does that make my thoughts less valid?</h3>

Cape Town is an incredible place to visit, with a billion of amazing things to offer -- beautiful views, beautiful people, a wealth of opportunity, a diverse and fun nightlife, a wealth of mountains and trails perfect for hiking and running. 

But, in terms of longer term living, there is no denying that there is still a good degree of racism that exists in Cape Town -- perhaps mostly because of where we are in its history. 

<h3>With that being said, it is the mindset of the people that will shape the future of a nation, and only time will tell the social progress that Cape Town, along with the rest of South Africa, can achieve in the coming decades.</h3>
