<h3 class="section-heading">The first month is always hard.</h3>

The first day I was in Spain, I got dropped off on a random street corner, almost got kicked out of my apartment on hour 1 due to a payment misunderstanding. When jokes get repeated 10 times for a foreigner who still has no clue what's being said, they are no longer funny.

The first month I was in NYC, I legitimately contemplated buying a ticket out to SF for the weekend. Let's just say that the cramped space, coupled with the undeniable episode of bedbugs drove me to cheapflights.com at 4 am in the morning many a night.

Who would've guessed that those two summers turned out to be the best in my life? Somehow it happened, it always does.

<h3>So, it really didn't surprise me at all when I started to have bouts of blues here in Cape Town.</h3>

It really does surprise me how <i>infrequently</i> I feel uncomfortable here. How easy it was to build relationships and form new attachments. It almost bothers me how quickly this new <i>lifestyle</i> has fallen into place.

That being said, the first month is always hard, and these are the things I miss the most, some more serious than others:

<h2>5. Electricity...all the time.</h2>

People. Loadshedding is a thing. For everyone not in South Africa, please look it up RIGHT NOW. This is important. This is what <i>actually</i> happens. The government just turns off electricity for huge areas at a time. Why is the rest of the world not talking about this?? How is this ok?

<h2>4. Summer</h2>

Ok to be perfectly clear, I admit, "winter" here is a complete joke. 60 degree weather is spring or fall at best. Everytime some complains about the cold, I seriously want to call the wah-bulance. But as I'm finding out, without central heating, winter here does not joke around. It gets a bit nippy when the sun's not out. Why am I wearing a jacket? It's supposed to be June? This is not helping my self-diagnosed Seasonal Affective Disorder.

<h2>3. Dollars</h2>

Look up the Dollar to Rand conversion rate. Realize that I am being paid in Rand. Look over at MIT degrees already gathering dust and angry emails from parents. Rinse. Repeat.

<h2>2. Free Time</h2>

This one's sort of a joke, since I never got free time at MIT either. But people tell me about this thing called free time, and it seems incredible. Like you get to do stuff you like that's not work. WHOA! It sounds nice in theory yeah? Maybe one of these days I'll figure out this whole balance thing and I'll try it out.


<h2>1. Being able to reference inside jokes from last year. Looking at your friend and knowing that something's up...and vice versa.</h2>

There's just something nice about reminicising about the good old times. This one's a shoutout to you my B5 Bros, my MIT family, and Tonka crew. Time isn't the most important part of friendship, but does a helluva good job when it comes to staying power.

And even though I'm probably having the most incredible experience of my life, have met some people I genuinely call my friends...

<h3>I really do still miss you guys. Is that too much?</h3>
