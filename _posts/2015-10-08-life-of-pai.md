<h3 class="section-heading">It's way too easy to get sucked into, what we affectionately call, the "Pai-hole".</h3>

Located in a valley, Pai is well known for it's natural beauty - hot springs, waterfalls, a canyon - as well as its ease of life and beautiful motorbiking. You'll hear the same story over and over: "I came for 3 days but stayed for 3 months" or "It started as 1 week but now I've been here for over a year."

Pai itself is an unassuming town, with few cars, few buildings, few landmarks, but a noticeably higher density of reggae bars and granola-crunchy-veg type restaurants. People don't come to Pai for the town though.

<h3>Pai is a <i>vibe</i>.</h3>

There is a charming freedom about being in Pai. It's a surreal bubble in which people can hit pause on life, an in between place for lost souls who should be looking but aren't trying really hard, and a refuge for those who have nothing to go back to, wandering in some way or another - until Pai found <i>them</i>.

There's no concept of time, days of the week, what's happening in the world outside. Oftentimes it's just you, your motorbike and some friends on an open road, or you, a book, and a hammock overlooking the sunset over a rice paddy.


Pai is one of those places that is not just a place.

<h3>It's a lifestyle.</h3>
