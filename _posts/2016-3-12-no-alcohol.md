<h3 class="section-heading">Last month, I attempted Sober February.</h3>

As a result of 1) my particular weak showing during January's No Added Sugar Challenge (understatement), combined with 2) my affinity towards craft IPAs and single malt scotch (yet another understatement), and 3) the tendency of <i>all</i> social life of 20-somethings in NYC to revolve around alcohol (<i>not</i> at all exaggerating. ok maybe a little bit exaggerating), people started taking bets on when I would break before February even started.

In the words of T Swift, the haters gonna hate (hate hate hate hate). I mustered all the willpower I should have been using in January, and promptly gave away all the goose islands I had in my fridge.

Despite the resolve, I also had bouts of self doubt. I was going to have to say no to a lot of people, a lot of times.

<h3>Procedure: the rules</h3>
No alcohol for the entire month, period, no exceptions, not in any way shape or form. I allowed myself leeway just in case I accidentally ate food that was cooked with alcohol (which actually happened, damn those bourbon brownies that looked like normal brownies) or if someone spiked my drink without my knowledge (which thankfully didn't happen, and then we would have larger things to worry about because, um, that would be sketchy af)

<h3>Observations: how I did</h3>
As expected, the first week was <b>hard</b>.

I told myself I would still go out in February, and wouldn't become a boring hermit. How different could it be? <i>Well</i>, if you're curious, here's the breakdown:

Needless to say, going out to the places I usually enjoyed was not the same, and frankly, <i>way</i> more tiring than I thought. If I was really going to follow-through on my commitment to this monthly challenge, I had to <b>rethink my weekends,</b> and more importantly, <b>commit to that change</b>.

I did a shitton of yoga. I went hiking. I hosted parties. I opted for dinners over drinks. I left places at reasonable times and didn't bother trying harder. I had heart-to-hearts that I remembered, and decisions that I actively made. I said no and didn't feel bad at all when I was tired. I slept, I slept a lot. I took the weekend to not only have fun, but also to rest, a concept I never really valued before.

And I felt <i>awesome</i>. <b>And <i>that's</i> when it really clicked.</b><br>

I felt so awesome that when February 29th came, I was almost kinda bummed. <br><br><i>Almost</i>.

<h3>Conclusions: what I learned</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>Rest is ok. We need more of it:</b> NYC truly is the city that never sleeps. As someone who is fairly active and extroverted, it's hard for me to sit still and not be <i>doing</i> something or meeting up with someone. Last month showed me that I need to more actively create time to relax and just <i>be</i>.</li>
  <li><b>The secret to a sober night out is seltzer lime:</b> no one gives a shit whether or not you're drinking if you don't draw attention to it. The moment people are aware is when they start to feel uncomfortable. Get a seltzer lime in a short glass, and you're good to go.</li>
  <li><b>No one really needs to go to the third location:</b> weird things happen at this point of the night</li>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusions: what's changed</h3>
<ol>
  <li>I make plans to do things for myself, by myself, and prioritize that.</li>
  <li>I view weekends as a time to not only celebrate the last week, but also to rejuvenate for the upcoming week, whatever that might mean.</li>
  <li>When I'm tired, I no longer fight it.</li>
</ol>
