<h3 class="section-heading">In the 1970s, the Khmer Rouge murdered 25% of the Cambodian population.</h3>

In a crazed effort to bring Cambodia back to its "pure" Khmer roots, Pol Pot killed anyone that posed a "threat" to the government, pushed a nation into starvation, and dislocated millions from their homes. It's gut wrenching to think of <b>how many</b> and <b>how</b> people died during that time, even more gut wrenching to see the spot where all of it happened.

I read the memoir, "First They Killed My Father" by Loung Ung, beforehand to give me a bit of context, but nothing compared to seeing the actual site in person.

The Killing Fields outside of Phnom Penh is just one location out of tens of thousands that the Khmer Rouge would take their victims to be murdered -- men, women, children...babies. $6 and a 45 min tuk-tuk ride will got me an hour-long audio-walking tour of the site.

<h3>It seemed a little strange and pretty dark at first.</h3>

People coming from all over the world to visit a place where there once were mass murders. There is literally a building with 7 stories of skulls, layers upon layers of excavated remains. A tree laced with string bracelets, to mark where babies were thrown. Signs cautioning visitors to avoid washed up clothing scraps and bone bits that resurface after hard rains.

But to be honest, my visit to the Killing Fields was one of the most powerful in my time in Cambodia.

<h3>We were all there, just to take a moment to acknowledge, mourn, and remember a time in history when the world had failed to.</h3>
