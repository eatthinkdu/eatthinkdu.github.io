<h3 class="section-heading"><a name="top">Cambodia</a></h3>
<b>Time spent:</b> 1 week<br>
<b>Suggested time:</b> 1.5-2 weeks<br>
<b>How to Get Around:</b> Use <b>buses</b> to get between cities. The most reliable bus internally is Giant Ibis. I also used Mekong Express to get to/from Vietnam. Pro-tip: if you're short on time and don't mind a perfect night's sleep, overnight buses are not that sketchy. Make sure you see which bed seat they book you if you're going alone though, some buses are weird and have double beds, and you don't want to be next to some rando. Use <b>tuk tuks</b> to get around within a city, and be sure to bargain rates!!<br>
<b>Food:</b> Need to go to night market in Phnom Penh. Eat the Fish Amok!! Also try the Kari/Khmer noodles.<br>

<h3>[Cities I Went]</h3>
<h4>Phnom Penh:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: must go. If you're short on time, spend a half day to a day here (I spent half a day and that was enough). </li>
  <li><b>What to do</b>: I saw the Killing Fields (sad, worth it, do some pre-reading before visiting, I read <i>First They Killed My Father</i> and thought taht was useful), and S21, the Genocide Museum (less impactful, but also worth it. Bring a student ID to get in for free.)</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: Mad Monkey Phnom Penh. Fun party type hostel. More beer pong than I've ever played in my life. Avoid if you want a good night's sleep and are not ok with meeting gap yah brits.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Siem Reap:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: best city I visited in Cambodia solely due to angkor wat. I spent 3 days there and that was enough. You could probably do 2.</li>
  <li><b>What to do</b>: Angkor Wat (plus all the other temples, including the smaller ones) - get a 3 day pass if you're into old shit, get a 1 day pass if you're going to say you went to Angkor Wat or if you're short on time. Get a tour guide so you know what's going on, and go at sunrise. Getting a 3 day pass is nice because you're going to be exhausted at like 11 am and then you can go back on subsequent days to see the smaller temples (which are way cool!). ATV sunset tour through the rice paddies is also worth it.</li>
  <li><b>Where I stayed</b>: Mad Monkey Siem Reap. Again, party type hostel but with a pool. Did not like it here.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sihanhoukville:</h4> 
  <ul><li><b>Thoughts</b>: honestly this place sucked and you should avoid at all costs. I spent 1 night and that was 1 night wasted. There's nothing to do here except drink, and the drinking is not that fun.</li></ul>
<h4>Koh Rong:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: idyllic island, cool if you want to properly beach bum. less developed than Thai islands, it's backpacker's paradise. You can easily get stuck here and not want to leave.</li>
  <li><b>What to do</b>: I chilled on the main beach for 2 days and it was glorious. This island also knows how to party, and the Cambodians will come out and join you. It's awesome.</li>
  <li><b>Where I stayed</b>: Three Brothers? I honestly don't remember but I got a private room for like $3 or something ridiculous. Monkey Island has nice bungalows though.</li>
</ul>

<h4>[Places I Wish I Went]</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Kampot</b>: lazy city on the river, supposed to be beautiful and a bit more authentic. was told to stay at arcadia.</li>
  <li><b>Battambang</b>: was also told this was a bit more authentic</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-heading"><a name="vietnam">Vietnam</a></h3>
<b>Time spent:</b> 3 weeks<br>
<b>Suggested time:</b> 4 weeks (that's how long you get on your visa)<br>
<b>Transportation:</b> <b>Sleeper buses</b> in Vietnam are awesome. Do not get the hop on/hop off bus deal, it's not worth it and it decreases flexibility. Plus the companies they put you with have varying degrees of sketchiness. Try to either motorbike or take the train through Hai Van Pass! That's the only place I would recommend not busing. Within a city, <b>taxis</b> are actually really cheap if you can split with others. Otherwise, motorbikes are the way to go (renting one yourself, or hiring a rider).<br>
<b>Food:</b> Banh mi, you should be paying 10.000-20.000 for it, 30.000 - 60.000 for pho. Would also recommend banh xeo (egg/bean sprout/seafood crepe pancake).<br>

<h3>[Cities I Went]</h3>
<h4>Saigon</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: just a crazy introduction to Vietnam, so many people and bustling all the time. amazing for street food, you can get awesome food at awesome prices, very easily.</li>
  <li><b>What to Do</b>: the War Remnants Museum is a must see for Americans! I didn't go see the Cu Chi Tunnels, no regrets. Just walk around and get a feel for the city.</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: Hideout Hostel, I think it was $8 for a 6 bed dorm and 2 free beers between 7-8 pm. Awesome place to meet people, bar crawl is meh but the people here are fun and friendly. Located in backpacker's district.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Dalat</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: Best city in the south by far. Must go if you're into nature and waterfalls, also climate is slightly cooler and temperature is actually bearable. Locals are super friendly. There's an amazing bakery, ask about it. Stay 2 days.</li>
  <li><b>What to Do</b>: Canyoning. Will run you around $35 for half day w/ lunch and transportation included, so worth it. Good spot to rent a moped/scooter and ride around in the mountains/countryside.</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: Cozy Nook Hostel, a homestay hostel run by an adorable family. Can by beers for about 10.000 dong (ie $0.50), they also run a homemade dinner each night for about $3, great time to meet people at the hostel over delicious food.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Hoi An</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: Just a super charming, old city. Lots of backpackers if you're looking to party, but also a ton of old cultural gems if you just want to explore. Also a beach.</li>
  <li><b>What to Do</b>: Recommend getting a pedal bike and biking around, from the ancient city (so pretty) to the beach (not as great) and just wandering. If you want custom made clothes, this is the place to do it for cheap (allow 3 days), but do your research beforehand or you'll get shit.</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: Sunflower Hotel is the really the only place in the city with a good location (includes pool!), but there are some good places on the beach if you prefer that (Under the Coconut Tree). About $6, ok crowd.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Hue</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: if you're short on time, skip. It's meh. Worth spending 1 day just to chill and explore the market.</li>
  <li><b>What to Do</b>: You could see the citadel but I thought it was overpriced so I didn't go. Must go to the market, pretend you're a local, and eat everything. DMZ tour was also not worth it, but Vinh Moc tunnels are interesting if you're into war stuff.</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: Hue Happy Homestay. Best part of Hue was this family, the most adorable family and the father is so nice.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Phong Nha</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: Best city/town in Vietnam by far. If you haven't read my other blog posts raving about this spot. It simply is this beautiful spot just tucked away from the main roads. Stay for 3 days if you can.</li>
  <li><b>What to Do</b>: Caving. Paradise Cave and Dark Cave are must dos. Rent your own motorbike and go to them yourself. If you have time, go to Pub with the Cold Beer, grab drinks, and eat the super fresh chicken dinner. If you have more time than that, go to the other 2 caves, the Phong Nha cave and the Tien Son Cave.</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: Easy Tiger. The only place to stay. Be sure to take advantage of their happy hours and live music nights!!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cat Ba Island</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: Beautiful island, must go if you want a cheaper alternative to the Ha Long Bay Cruises from Hanoi (think $50 max instead of $200 min for 3 nights). You need to take a bus to another bus, to a boat, to a bus to get here though. Stay for 3-4 days, lounge, and enjoy life.</li>
  <li><b>What to Do</b>: take a Ha Long Bay cruise, kayak, rent a motorbike and ride around the island, go to the veg hot pot restaurant called Green Buddha, chill on the beach</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: Cat Ba Central Hostel. One of the only good backpackers on the island.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sa Pa</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: Must go if you enjoy trekking. Picturesque, rice paddies direct off of a postcard. Food is pretty shitty here though. Stay for 3ish days, more if you want to go hiking longer. It really is so pretty here.</li>
  <li><b>What to Do</b>: Homestay trek with one of the Hmong mama's, buy knock-off North Face apparel for dirt cheap</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: Mountain View Hostel, part of Vietnam Backpacker's hostels circuit.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Hanoi</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: I honestly didn't stay here for that long (1/2 day) so didn't do too much exploring. Feels more modern metropolitan than Saigon, and even crazier. Good food and going out.</li>
  <li><b>What to Do</b>: Eat. Drink.</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: Hanoi Rocks. The only good place to stay. Trust me.</li>
</ul>

<h3 name="thailand" class="section-heading"><a name="thailand">Thailand</a></h3>
<b>Time spent:</b> 3 weeks<br>
<b>Suggested time:</b> 4-6 weeks<br>
<b>Transportation:</b> The sleep train from Bangkok to Chiang Mai and vice versa is actually pretty awesome. Buses also work (chiang mai to pai by bus or rent a motorcycle and ride 3 hours). Flying is fastest. To get to the islands, you need to hop on a ferry (would recommend getting a flight to ferry deal, or a bus to ferry deal). Be wary of tuk tuk scams in Bangkok. Otherwise, tuk tuks and red cabs are the way to go (red cabs are actually cheapest, fixed price of 20 baht per person). In Pai, the only way to get anywhere is by motorbike.<br>
<b>Food:</b> Food here is the bomb dot com, by far the best. Curries, papaya salad, pad thai, noodles, coconut ice creams etc. Take a cooking course if you're interested in learning more!<br>

<h3>[Cities I Went]</h3>
<h4>Chiang Mai</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: good base for exploring the north. lots of pre-planned activities/excursions. Can easily stay a week, but would probably only need 3-4 days to see/do everything.</li>
  <li><b>What to Do</b>: (in order of awesomeness) elephant sanctuary visit, shopping at the sunday market, explore temples, jungle trek, cooking class</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: Hug Hostel (would not recommend), Spicy Thai (expensive but awesome crew of backpackers), Deejai Backpackers (best deal by far)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pai</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: chill, hippie town. only go if you can tolerate a bunch of high expats. not a place to experience culture. so pretty and relaxing though.</li>
  <li><b>What to Do</b>: the only thing you can do in this town is rent a moped and ride out to waterfalls, a canyon, and other nature-y type things.</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: Spicy Pai. Only good place to stay. Communcal. Chill. Overlooks a rice paddy and is beautiful.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Koh Tao</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: best island for scuba diving. and scuba diving is so worth it. way less commercial than koh samui, and less party party than koh phangan. stay 4-5 days to get scuba certified.</li>
  <li><b>What to Do</b>: get scuba certified for dirt cheap and/or relax on the beach</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: I took classes from Mojo Divers, housing was included.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bangkok</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: I only spent 1 day here so can't really say much about this city, except for the fact that it felt really dirty and grimy because of the sex industry.</li>
  <li><b>What to Do</b>: Go to Chattuchuk weekend market and buy tons of stuff. Go out near Khao San road.</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: Born Free. It was super cheap.</li>
</ul>
