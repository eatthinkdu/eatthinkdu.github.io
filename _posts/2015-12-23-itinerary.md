<h3 class="section-heading">Cambodia</h3>
<b>Time spent:</b> 1 week<br>
<b>Suggested time:</b> 1.5-2 weeks<br>
<b>How to Get Around:</b> Use <b>buses</b> to get between cities. The most reliable bus internally is Giant Ibis. I also used Mekong Express to get to/from Vietnam. Pro-tip: if you're short on time and don't mind a perfect night's sleep, overnight buses are not that sketchy. Make sure you see which bed seat they book you if you're going alone though, some buses are weird and have double beds, and you don't want to be next to some rando. Use <b>tuk tuks</b> to get around within a city, and be sure to bargain rates!!<br>
<b>Food:</b> Need to go to night market in Phnom Penh. Eat the Fish Amok!! Also try the Kari/Khmer noodles.<br>

<h3>[Cities I Went]</h3>
<h4>Phnom Penh:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: must go. If you're short on time, spend a half day to a day here (I spent half a day and that was enough). </li>
  <li><b>What to do</b>: I saw the Killing Fields (sad, worth it, do some pre-reading before visiting, I read <i>First They Killed My Father</i> and thought taht was useful), and S21, the Genocide Museum (less impactful, but also worth it. Bring a student ID to get in for free.)</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: Mad Monkey Phnom Penh. Fun party type hostel. More beer pong than I've ever played in my life. Avoid if you want a good night's sleep and are not ok with meeting gap yah brits.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Siem Reap:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: best city I visited in Cambodia solely due to angkor wat. I spent 3 days there and that was enough. You could probably do 2.</li>
  <li><b>What to do</b>: Angkor Wat (plus all the other temples, including the smaller ones) - get a 3 day pass if you're into old shit, get a 1 day pass if you're going to say you went to Angkor Wat or if you're short on time. Get a tour guide so you know what's going on, and go at sunrise. Getting a 3 day pass is nice because you're going to be exhausted at like 11 am and then you can go back on subsequent days to see the smaller temples (which are way cool!). ATV sunset tour through the rice paddies is also worth it.</li>
  <li><b>Where I stayed</b>: Mad Monkey Siem Reap. Again, party type hostel but with a pool. Did not like it here.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sihanhoukville:</h4> 
  <ul><li><b>Thoughts</b>: honestly this place sucked and you should avoid at all costs. I spent 1 night and that was 1 night wasted. There's nothing to do here except drink, and the drinking is not that fun.</li></ul>
<h4>Koh Rong:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: idyllic island, cool if you want to properly beach bum. less developed than Thai islands, it's backpacker's paradise. You can easily get stuck here and not want to leave.</li>
  <li><b>What to do</b>: I chilled on the main beach for 2 days and it was glorious. This island also knows how to party, and the Cambodians will come out and join you. It's awesome.</li>
  <li><b>Where I stayed</b>: Three Brothers? I honestly don't remember but I got a private room for like $3 or something ridiculous. Monkey Island has nice bungalows though.</li>
</ul>

<h4>[Places I Wish I Went]</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Kampot</b>: lazy city on the river, supposed to be beautiful and a bit more authentic. was told to stay at arcadia.</li>
  <li><b>Battambang</b>: was also told this was a bit more authentic</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-heading">Thailand</h3>
<b>Time spent:</b> 3 weeks<br>
<b>Suggested time:</b> 4-6 weeks<br>
<b>Transportation:</b> The sleep train from Bangkok to Chiang Mai and vice versa is actually pretty awesome. Buses also work (chiang mai to pai by bus or rent a motorcycle and ride 3 hours). Flying is fastest. To get to the islands, you need to hop on a ferry (would recommend getting a flight to ferry deal, or a bus to ferry deal). Be wary of tuk tuk scams in Bangkok. Otherwise, tuk tuks and red cabs are the way to go (red cabs are actually cheapest, fixed price of 20 baht per person). In Pai, the only way to get anywhere is by motorbike.<br>
<b>Food:</b> Food here is the bomb dot com, by far the best. Curries, papaya salad, pad thai, noodles, coconut ice creams etc. Take a cooking course if you're interested in learning more!<br>

<h3>[Cities I Went]</h3>
<h4>Chiang Mai</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: good base for exploring the north. lots of pre-planned activities/excursions. Can easily stay a week, but would probably only need 3-4 days to see/do everything.</li>
  <li><b>What to Do</b>: (in order of awesomeness) elephant sanctuary visit, shopping at the sunday market, explore temples, jungle trek, cooking class</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: Hug Hostel (would not recommend), Spicy Thai (expensive but awesome crew of backpackers), Deejai Backpackers (best deal by far)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pai</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: chill, hippie town. only go if you can tolerate a bunch of high expats. not a place to experience culture. so pretty and relaxing though.</li>
  <li><b>What to Do</b>: the only thing you can do in this town is rent a moped and ride out to waterfalls, a canyon, and other nature-y type things.</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: Spicy Pai. Only good place to stay. Communcal. Chill. Overlooks a rice paddy and is beautiful.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Koh Tao</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: best island for scuba diving. and scuba diving is so worth it. way less commercial than koh samui, and less party party than koh phangan. stay 4-5 days to get scuba certified.</li>
  <li><b>What to Do</b>: get scuba certified for dirt cheap and/or relax on the beach</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: I took classes from Mojo Divers, housing was included.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bangkok</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Thoughts</b>: I only spent 1 day here so can't really say much about this city, except for the fact that it felt really dirty and grimy because of the sex industry.</li>
  <li><b>What to Do</b>: Go to Chattuchuk weekend market and buy tons of stuff. Go out near Khao San road.</li>
  <li><b>Where I Stayed</b>: Born Free. It was super cheap.</li>
</ul>
