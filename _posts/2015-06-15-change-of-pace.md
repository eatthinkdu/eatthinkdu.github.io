<h3 class="section-heading">If Cape Town is living a million miles a minute, Stellenbosch is straight up ambling.</h3>

I stayed behind after the Spice Route tour to spend the weekend with Emily, who is interning in Stellenbosch for the summer. Stellenbosch was definitely a smaller town -- not many cars, few people, even fewer beggars. The town seemed predominantly Afrikaans, and it was the first time in South Africa where I was in situations where I couldn't understand what was going on around me. All in all, it was a well needed break from the fast life with iXperience in Cape Town.

<h3>Highlights of the trip include:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>beautiful countryside scenery</li>
  <li>everything was way cheaper. I mean, R5 ice cream, come on</li>
  <li>better service and an adorably nice waiter at a great steak restaurant</li>
  <li>a real apartment with a real room and a real kitchen</li>
  <li>quiet</li>
  <li>getting to see Emily!</li>
</ul>

<h3>At the end of the day though, there's no place I'd rather be than Cape Town :)</h3><br>
