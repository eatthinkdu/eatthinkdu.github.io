<h3 class="section-heading">I just had the most incredible weekend.</h3>

Of friends, of fun, of adventure, memories for a lifetime, being young and being reckless. Feeling close without actually being close, but just enjoying each otherâ€™s company and travelling together. 

Just a month ago we were just a collection of strangers, but we had stumbled into maybe, probably, definitely too much bonding, and whether we wanted to or not, had become an iX family. 

The weekend was packed with scheduled activities, from visiting caves to riding ostriches, but my favorite moments were the times when we were driving, just staring out the window looking out across the changing landscape the sunset with the mountains and the colors the clouds the trees. Those were the times when the thought crossed my mind that things could not possibly get better than this, that this was perfection and just the act of <b>being</b> was enough.

For those who don't like to read, I made a video of all the pictures I took. For everyone else, read on for the sparknotes version of the weekend. <br>

<h3>Ostrich Riding</h3>

First off, it might be safe to say that ostriches are probably the dumbest animals known to man. Look at their heads, there is actually physically no room for a brain. Second, ostriches are definitely not meant to be ridden, and it was one of the funniest things to witness.

<h3>Animal Sanctuary</h3>

Even though the animal sanctuary was a bit like a glorified zoo, I'm not gonna lie, getting to pet a cheetah was simultaneously so against nature, and also the coolest thing ever. These animals are running, hunting machines. Now domesticated in your nearest South African resrve so that hoards of Americans can snuggle it and snap selfies. Tourism at its finest or most ridiculous?

<h3>Backpackers Hostel</h3>

Our drive up to our hostel by the beach was idealistic like no other, with the sun setting, ocean to our right, and the mist and clouds just hitting the mountains. A bunch of us decided to head to the beach for a night swim, and it really did feel like we were just a bunch of little kids and the beach was our giant sandbox and the ocean was our kiddie pool. The next day we found out a surfer lost his leg to a shark in the <i>next bay over</i>. Go figure.

<h3>Rastafarian Community Tour</h3>

Epic trip with an even more epic tour guide (shoutout to brother Zeb). Totally vibing with the culture and the music. Peace, love, and fun grass.

<h3>Elephant Riding</h3>

Elephants are just incredibly adorable creatures, and riding off into the sunset with elephants in South Africa held twangs of surrealism, nostalgia, and cheesy tourist vibes. They always look like they're smiling. Not sure if other animals really compete there. The count of number of animals we rode that weren't meant to be ridden goes up by 1.


<h3>Bungee Jumping</h3>

So cool I had to write a separate post about it <a href="{% post_url 2015-06-28-a-216m-leap-of-faith %}" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h3>Game Drive</h3>

**THE** safari experience, mini edition. We took a open top 4x4 and saw a whole lot of animals. Highlights include perhaps the best tour guide in the world, Leroy, getting close to the lions without dying, and witnessing a carcass recently torn up by a cheetah.
