<h3 class="section-heading">The last time I was in Shanghai, I was 16.</h3>

I distinctly remember stepping out of the central train station at night with my family, into a sea of faces that looked too similar to mine, being reluctantly herded forward because we were stuck in a mob. Women were screaming. Children were wailing. I'm pretty sure I cried because I was so upset.

<h3>7 years later, I'm so glad I gave Shanghai another shot.</h3>

Shanghai has become an incredible city with the future and the past coexisting, with sky walkways and tall shiny skyscrapers on one side of the river, and beautifully preserved temples and slightly grungy open air markets on the other.

My favorite part though, had to be the food and the quality you could get for almost nothing.

<h3>Here's my guide to eating in Shanghai -- all for under $5.</h3>

<h3>Bao: $0.50 for 2</h3>
<i>Bao zi</i>, or just <i>bao</i>, are steamed buns with filling on the inside, and are a really popular, traditional Chinese snack or meal. Across 3 days, I tried the veg (left), <i>naidan</i> (right, essentially a custard made with eggs and milk), red bean, and carrot. All delicious. All $0.25 each. Sold at a little stand right next to where I was staying where they only spoke Shanghainese.

<h3>Xiao Long Bao: $1.50</h3>

<i>Xiao long bao</i>, or soup dumplings, are probably Shanghai's trademark dish, and are usually filled with pork and/or shrimp. Also steamed, these dumplings got their name from having a tiny bit of soup packed in with the filling. Probably ate these everyday for a week, so delicious. Ordered these at a "fast food" type of restaurant, meaning it was literally just food served fast.

<h3>Bubble Tea: $1.25</h3>

Instead of coffee, tea is all the rage here, especially milk tea (essentially milk and sugar with a splash of tea). Ever since coming to China, I have successfully drank at least 1 milk tea a day. Instead of just going with the standard boba pearls, you can get all sorts of other toppings inside, like <i>sanxiongdi</i> (tapioca pearls, pudding, grass jelly) or <i>xiaomi</i> (basically mini tapioca pearls). Low key obsessed.

<h3>Noodles: $1.25</h3>

Full confession: my Chinese reading ability is existent, but not that good. I walked into a noodle shop where the menu was all in Chinese and ordered the first thing I could read -- noodles with egg and vegetables. Got lucky, the noodles happened to be handmade, soup was delicious.
