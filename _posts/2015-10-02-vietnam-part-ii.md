<h3 class="section-heading">I hate to play favorites, but the north of Vietnam was the best.</h3>

My last 10 days consisted mostly of trekking, exploring, visiting quirky joints, and being surrounded by awe-inspring nature. Everything I ever wanted but didn't expect.

<h3>Phong Nha</h3>
<p>Hands down my favorite spot in Vietnam. Backpackers come to Phong Nha for one thing and one thing only - caving in the national park. As a result, there is just one backpacker's hostel, Easy Tiger, in a small makeshift town with just a couple of restaurants, cafes, and bars. In total, our group visited 4 caves across 2 days, each unique and worthwhile for different reasons. The Paradise Cave stuck out for its sheer size and structural beauty, but the Dark Cave was my favorite just for the adventure experience of kayaking, ziplining, swimming, and trodding through a mud pit. Besides caving, Phong Nha is home to Pub with the Cold Beer, where customers can catch and kill their own chicken, and then eat it immediately. Quite possibly the best chicken dinner I've had in my entire life, with cold beer (as promised) and hammocks to boot. Easy Tiger itself was an awesome hub, with live music almost every night. Take me back?</p>

<h3>Cat Ba Island</h3>
<p>Instead of taking the infamous $200+ Ha Long Bay booze cruise from Hanoi, I opted to take a 1 day Ha Long Bay tour from Cat Ba for $20. Weather was teetering between perfect and sprinkly, which was less than ideal, but we still had an awesome time cruising, swimming, snorkelling, kayaking, and just chilling on a boat together. I also learned how to <a href="{% post_url 2015-09-22-best-of-vietnam %}" target="_blank">moped!</a></p>

<h3>Sa Pa</h3>
In short, breathtaking and surreal. I'll let the pictures speak for themselves. We spent 1 full day trekking from town to a homestay in a Hmong village. We walked through jungle, down lush rice paddies, across a river. If that sounded like a Dora the Explorer episode, that's because it still blows my mind that a place that stunning exists in real life, and that people live there.

<h3>Hanoi</h3>
Literally spent maybe 4 waking hours in Hanoi, which I concluded was actually crazier than Saigon. Was caught in a lot of rain, and running short on time, so wasn't able to do as much exploring as I would've liked.
