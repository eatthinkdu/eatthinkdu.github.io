<h3 class="section-heading">Admitting our limits, and that we have limits, is an exercise in humility.</h3>

Realizing that humanity itself has limits, and seeing those limits, was that, but at a whole different magnitude. Today, and only for a moment, I looked over a cliff, saw nothing but ocean crashing into mountains melding into sky, and felt like I was seeing the edge of existence.

We were overlooking the water at the southwestern most tip of Africa after having scrambled up some rocks when the thought crossed my mind that the next land mass over was Antarctica and it felt strange to me how the world suddenly seemed so confined. The thought should have been obvious and insignificant, but to me it was neither of those things.

Our crew headed out early to drive south along a scenic coastline to Cape Point, and lastly, Cape of Good Hope, stopping along some view points along the way. It still surprises me how the mountains never fail to impress me, and that a beautiful sunset or a massive cliff of rocks next to water never gets old. Besides being blessed with incredible T-shirt weather, it was a fun day of exploring, exotic animals, and being impressed by nature.
