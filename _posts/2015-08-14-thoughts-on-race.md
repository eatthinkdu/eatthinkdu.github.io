<h3 class="section-heading">In Cape Town, I sometimes feel like I've been time warped back to pre-civil rights period America.</h3>

Taken back to a social transition period when women and black people were still in the midst of that transition. Which, you know, makes sense, since apartheid ended a mere 20 years ago.

<h3>Race is not something I've mentioned at all so far in my blog.</h3>

Yet it is something I think about here a lot, and something I think is important to share. I am conflicted between being upset about what I'm seeing in Cape Town, yet realizing these problems are not isolated to just this part of the world.

Most of the stuff I've noticed is pretty innocent, others confusing, some questionable, a few straight up disappointing. 

The truth is that 20 years is a blink of an eye in the span of history, and only time will tell the social progress that Cape Town, along with the rest of South Africa, can achieve in the coming decades.

<h3>6 Moments That Left an Impression On Me</h3>
1. <i>That time when...</i>I walked into Aces of Spades (my favorite bar), and realized that I was the only non-white person in the entire place. The place was packed. Somehow became hyper-aware of this fact and quickly realized that this all-black or all-white situation was the case with <b>a lot</b> of the social scene in Cape Town. 
2. <i>That time when...</i>the entire wait staff at a cafe tried to speak "Chinese" to me when I asked for water. Would later receive a verbal apology by manager. Mostly though, all I ever want to do is casually walk down the street but "Nihao" gets shouted at me on the reg. Daily basis y'all.
3. <i>That time when...</i>I was talking to a South African legislator, who didn't believe I was actually from America. So the follow-up question to "where are you from?" was naturally "no, but where are you <i>really</i> from?" I get this response <b>a lot</b> when I travel, but for some reason was surprised when he asked me that. Maybe it's because I've never been asked that from someone whose first language is English. And you know, is educated and writes laws for a living. 
4. <i>That time when...</i>I was running from Greenpoint to Camps Bay, and noticed that every construction worker, house worker, and parking attendant I passed was a black man working for a white family. All the wait staff of every restaurant on the street I lived on were black, managed by a white manager. Believe this is because of something called Black Economic Empowerment but could be wrong.
5. <i>That time when...</i>I didn't see any white Capetonians taking the train. Actually, to be honest, didn't see any non-black Capetonians in the entire vicinity of the train station.
6. <i>That time when...</i>I asked my black South African friends about race and got personal stories and a history lesson. I asked my white South African friends about race and would get "It's not the way things should be, but that's just the way things are."
