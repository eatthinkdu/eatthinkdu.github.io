<h3 class="section-heading">This year, I didn't make New Years Resolutions.</h3>

They suck. I never follow them. I'm always too ambitious for my own good, and they are the same every year. <i>Exercise. Go to church. Read. Be nicer.</i>

This year, instead of making year-long promises to myself, I decided to take a different approach.

<h3>Run 12 different lifestyle experiments, all exactly 1 month long, to see how it affects, and possibly improves, my life.</h3>

Yes, <i>experiments</i>. They're not meant to induce habits (though I'm guessing it might inspire some change, jury's still out on this), but simply just to see what I can learn by changing one variable a month. <b>Every month, I'm challenging myself to change one thing about how I currently live my life, whether that be cutting something out, adding something in, or simply acting in a way I wouldn't normally.</b>

January's challenge?

<h3>No added sugar.</h3>

The inspiration behind this lifestyle experiment was the food documentary <a href="http://fedupmovie.com/" target="_blank">Fed Up</a>, which is about the role sugar plays in the childhood obesity epidemic, one of the most depressing subjects out there. Seriously, go watch it and you will want to avoid all processed foods.

If you're thinking "HA Erica, don't be silly, sugar is in literally everything, your challenge impossible," you have a good point. Read on.

<h3>Procedure: the rules</h3>
For the month of January, I attempted to avoid all foods that contained <b>added sugar</b>. Foods with "sugar", and other equivalents, listed as an ingredient were off limit. foods with naturally occurring sugars (ie fruits, complex carbs) were ok. Turns out "sugar" goes by a lot of names, ranging from acids, to chemicals, to molasses, which ruled out almost all processed foods and white breads/pastas. But most importantly no chocolate (honestly, why did I do this voluntarily?).

You guys are probably noticing that there are obvious beverages that definitely contain sugar. Namely beer. I made the conscious decision to allow drinking alcoholic beverages during this period (limited to spirits, beer, and wine, ie no cocktails), knowing that this could possibly derail my experiment.

<h3>Observations: how I did</h3>

I would love to report back that I was successful and that I ate no added sugar and life was awesome but unfortunately, my added sugar intake this month looked a little like this:

<p style="margin-top:-10px;padding-bottom:20px;width:600px"><i>x-axis represents time, y-axis represents sugar intake, aka a pitiful look at my lack of success. notable incidents marked.</i></p></center>

On one hand I'm kinda disappointed in myself. On the other hand, I think I was chasing after an unachievable goal.

<b>The stories behind the letters:</b>
<ol type="A">
<li>Day 1 and I'm pumped. Filled with resolve and determination, I head to the kitchen of my office and stir up some Emergen-C (it's January after all, and getting sick would be a major bummer). Only after downing the entire glass do I realize I've made a huge mistake and Emergen-C is pure sugar. Off to a rocky start.<br>

<li>Weekdays are easy, with the occasional struggle of eating out at restaurants. I take the ignorance is bliss route and try to pick out dishes I think will contain the least amount of sugar. Usually this means salads without the dressing or copious amounts of cheese. Cheese intake this month skyrockets.<br>

<li>Weekend 1 rolls around and things are getting tricky. After a few beers, the inevitable happens. I go for a burger and eat the bun and sauces with it.<br><br>

<li>Frustated from my lapse, I kick it into high gear and muscle my way through a sugar free week by avoiding Emergen-C at all costs, diverting my energy back into gouda, and replacing all sugar cravings with Triscuits. By the end of the 2nd week, I'm smooth sailing and not even second glancing at the cookies in our office kitchen.

<li>Started the 3rd weekend breaking the no-cocktail rule, spiraled into a week with 2 ice cream sandwiches (my friends claimed they were tofu!), a chocolate bar, not 1, but 3 restaurant week desserts, 2 slices of pizza, and a nutella banana crepe while under the influence on various days of the week. Lots of alcohol, lots of added sugar. If you haven't noticed a correlation, hopefully the lightbulb is going off for you.

</li>
<li>
Final stretch, and I'm killin it. Turned down desserts not only once, but three times, and stuck to my guns throughout the weekend. FINALLY. After all the struggling, I'm finishing strong and nailing my goals.

<h3>Conclusions: what I learned</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>Set yourself up for success:</b> sometimes goals are doomed to fail from the start. Providing such a strict definitely of "added sugar," making my allowance zero, and allowing alcohol consumption just turned into a mousetrap, only a matter of <i>when</i> not <i>if</i> I was going to fail. Next time I should structure my goals and environment to be conducive to success.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Learn from missteps, but move on, don't dwell:</b> week 3 sugar performance was pretty embarassing. In fact, I probably ate more sugar that week than I did without this no added sugar challenge. Though demotivating, I knew that I still had a week left to prove myself, and couldn't take on the attitude of "might as well just give up." I just got on with life. </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Reducing added sugar intake was easy, eliminating it was impossible:</b> turns out I was already eating a pretty low-sugar diet so getting rid of desserts and processed food was really easy for me. Unfortunately, added sugar is hidden in almost everything that doesn't grow out of the ground. Living in America, I would say cutting out added sugar entirely is actually impossible.</li> 
</ol>
<h3>Conclusions: what's changed</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Triscuit and gouda cheese intake has skyrocketed to a box and a wheel (respectively) a week.</li>
  <li>Granola and granola bar consumption has plummeted to zero.</li>
  <li>Lots of unsweetened almond milk. Have switched to the plain versions of a lot of foods (popchips, yogurts, etc), and don't really plan on switching back.</li>
  <li>Way more conscious of ingredients in foods, especially when eating out.</li>
  <li>Less of a need for caffeine. Not sure why this is the case, but haven't really needed to drink coffee in the past week.</li>
  <li>No desire to eat sweets. Except for chocolate. I always want chocolate.</li>
</ol>

So, I guess I wasn't too successful in the challenge - I ended up struggling quite a bit. However, every cloud has a silver lining - I did see a noticeable change in my life, and have continued to eat lower amounts of sugar. Woo!

<h3> Stay tuned for next month! ...I'm trying sober February.</h3>
