<h3 class="section-heading">I recently returned to America after close to 3 months solo backpacking in Asia.</h3>

I have so much to tell and want to share, but at the same time, don't know what to say. Going through the logistics of which countries I visited and my itinerary, coupled with some generic adjectives like "awesome" and "amazing" is my easy way out - but it just doesn't even come close. I get stumped at the questions -  "What was your favorite part?" "What did you learn?" "Are you happy to be back?" - not because I don't have answers, but because I don't know where to start.

<h3>This trip changed me. But not necessarily in the ways I thought it would.</h3>

I did, however, come back more sure of who I want to become, more confident in who I am, and more ok with who I used to be. It taught me about the infiniteness of life, the necessity of love, the worth of people, the illusion of time. Here are a few of the most important things I learned along the way.

<h3>#1. The past provides context, but doesn't need to define the future.</h3>

I think <i>every</i> experience we ever have in our lives - from the monotony we fall into from our daily routines, to drifting aimlessly ad puposelessly, to all the times we spectalularly fuck up and keep fucking up - they all make up who we are. 

We are the good, and we are the bad. 

<h3>#2. Meeting people is a skill that can be developed.</h3>

For all the recent grads out there, we all know meeting people get considerably harder after college. No more random drunken frat parties where you become biffles with literally everone in the room because you're wearing the same color shirt or some other dumb shit like that. But solo travelling taught me that meeting poeple is a skill, and something you can get better at just by practicing, and something worth practicing. 

<h3>Lesson #2. Travel Erica should be real life Erica.</h3>

Something about leaving the country transforms me. I'm not saying I'm a completely different person. To to a certain degree, I am way more willing to take risks, agree to do dumb shit way more frequently, and don't hesitate to stand up for myself when things are out of line. It's weird - why do I need to fly halfway across the world to be another version of me? Now that I'm back in NYC (and away from MIT, phew), I can feel myself bringing the same attitude and independence and courage back with me.

And Travel Erica has never felt so at home.

<h3>Lesson #3. The right people at the right time can change your life...if you let them.</h3>
I used to hate it when people said "My favorite part of [working/studying/being] here is the people." That's almost as bad as telling me "I love the culture." What does that actually mean. There is nothing useful about those statements. Seriously.

But after meeting tens of people every week, and hundreds of people across months, I have to say that it's true. 

Over the past few months, I've met people who have challenged my beliefs, who have forced me to confront my past demons, who have cared about me in magnitudes I couldn't comprehend, who have restored my faith in random acts of kindness bestowed upon lost strangers.

People who make you feel whole, and human, and connected. People that teach you about themselves, and then about yourself.

<h3>Lesson #3. Fuck imposter syndrome.</h3>

Basically, 

<h3>Lesson #4. Being scared is a calculated challenge. Prove yourself wrong.</h3>
