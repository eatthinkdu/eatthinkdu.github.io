<h3 class="section-heading">I recently returned to America after close to 3 months in Asia.</h3>

It's a little weird.

My friends are already real people with real jobs and real lives. I'm not moving every couple of days, and my backpack has been sitting in a corner for a while.

It's really nice.

There's toilet paper in every bathroom. I can confidently tell a joke in English. Tap water and fast service are a thing.

I have so much to tell, so much to share, but at the same time, nothing to say, no words. I get stumped at the simplest questions - "What was your favorite part?" "What did you learn?" "Are you happy to be back?"

Some of the things I feel don't make sense to me at all, and that's why I hesitate. How can I care, and be so attached to people in such a short period of time? Why do those moments mean so much to me? Why do we need to fly halfway across the country for these shared experiences? How have I changed?

<blockquote>"You get a strange feeling when you're about to leave a place, like you'll not only miss the people you love but you'll miss the person you are now at this time and this place, because you'll never be this way ever again." -Reading Lolita in Tehran (Azar Nafisi)</blockquote>

<h3>Let people in.</h3>

<h3>Say yes.</h3>

<h3>Prove yourself wrong.</h3>

<h3>You are the coolest person you will ever hang out with.</h3>
