<h3 class="section-heading">It's way too easy to get sucked into, what we affectionately call, the "Pai-hole".</h3>

Located in a valley, Pai is well known for it's natural beauty - hot springs, waterfalls, a canyon - as well as its ease of life and beautiful motorbiking. You'll hear the same story over and over: "I came for 3 days but stayed for 3 months" or "It started as 1 week but now I've been here for over a year."

Pai itself is an unassuming town, with relatively few cars, a noticeably higher density of reggae bars and granola-crunchy-veg type restaurants, and streets littered with what I can only assume are drunk-food vendors (nachos, pad thai, crepes, ydig?). It's not a town though.

<h3>Pai is a <i>vibe</i>.</h3>
