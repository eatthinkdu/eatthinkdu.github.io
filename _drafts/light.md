<h3 class="section-heading">Today's the day!</h3>

After a great week in Hangzhou, my backpacking trip has officially begun with Shanghai. From Shanghai, I'll be spending a few days in Hong Kong, then Singapore, then straight to Vietnam to cross to border into Cambodia. From Cambodia, the hope is to travel back to Vietnam north, from Ho Chi Minh to Sapa, maybe into Laos and hopefully back into the north of Thailand, ending my trip with a visit to my grandparent's place in Taian, the place where I lived from age 2 to 4.
