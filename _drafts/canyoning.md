<h3 class="section-heading">"Don't be lazy, get crazy!"</h3>

It's 7 AM, I'm in a white van with 9 people I just met, having been in Dalat for fewer than 11 hours, while 3 overly enthusiastic Vietnamese men shout that phrase at us. Multiple times.

I had arrived at my homestay the night before by sleeper bus from Ho Chi Minh city, and stumbled into a huge conversation about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyoning" target="_blank">canyoning</a>.

<center>
<i>"You climb down waterfalls! You take a 11 m jump!"<br>
"You have to do it! It's amazing!"</i>
</center>
Damn peer pressure.

<center>
<i>"...yeah except the 11 m jump is a bit scarier, you have to clear about 1 m of rocks. You have to run otherwise you're done for."</i>
</center>

Damn rocks.

<h3>But after jumping off a <u><a href="{% post_url 2015-06-28-a-216m-leap-of-faith %}" target="_blank">216 m bridge</a></u>, how scary could a 11 m waterfall be?</h3>

Our group of 10, including 3 others from my homestay, scramble out of the van onto the side of a road about 20 minutes outside of the city, and then our energetic guides, Banana, Tree, and Tiger, help us put our equipment on: life jackets, harnesses, helmets, gloves...even knee pads.

<h3>The adventure begins.</h3>

After trekking in the jungle for about 15 minutes, we arrive at a small waterfall (read: bump in the stream) and Tree stops us. First up is water sliding! 

<center>
<i>"Ladies first!"</i>
</center>

Tree grabs my hand, and although a little hesitant to be the first in the entire group, I say fuck it and go with him. I barely sit down before I feel Tree grabbing my ankles, rotating me, until I realize what's happening.

Wait, what, hey, feet first feet first!

I'm yelling, pleading, but it's too late and I am being swept away by the water, head first, back to the unknown, unaware of what's ahead. 

<h3>And that's the genius of it, what makes the ride almost peaceful.</h3>

The fact that you can't see what's ahead, there's nothing distracting you, and all you can do is ride the feeling, the movement at <i>that</i> moment in time. You don't know when you'll plunge into the water, just that you will, and there's no planning ahead or bracing yourself.

After a couple rounds (including some tandem sliding), our group moves on to abseiling -- scaling down waterfalls.

<center>
<i>"Ladies first!"</i>
</center>

Tree gestures to me again. I'm beginning to see a pattern. Before I start scaling the waterfall, I get one heads up.

<center>
<i>"You'll run out of rope, so you'll have to let go and fall the last 4 m."</i>
</center>

I make my way down the waterfall fairly easily (woo!), until I run out of rope -- as expected. Getting ready for my real life trust fall, I take a break from staring at the rock face, and look down.

  <p style="margin-top:-10px;padding-bottom:20px"><i>Abseiling down the first waterfall.</i></p>
</center>

<h3>Ha. There is <i>no</i> way that is 4 m. There is absolutely no way.</h3>

I look up at Tree, I look down at Tiger, I look back up at Tree, expecting them to contradict what I know is coming next.

<center>
  <i>"1, 2, 3!!"</i>
</center>

Before my brain and body registers what is happening, I've pushed off the waterfall, let go of the rope, and have already landed in the water. 

<center>
  <img src="{{site.url}}/img/du/canyon/falling.jpg" height="300px" width="600px" style="padding:20px;display:inline-block"/>
  <p style="margin-top:-10px;padding-bottom:20px"><i>Letting go. I do not remember this moment.</i></p>
</center>


My landing is calm and still compared to the force of the waterfall, the water is shallow enough that I walk to shore to await the others. I watch over and over again, as each person reaches the end, as each person scoffs when it is their turn to trust, when it is their turn to fall. 

<h3>Before every jump is a bit of disbelief and doubt, a moment of hesitation, almost as if it's built into our very nature to be a bit skeptical, even when we know we'll be ok.</h3>

This exact suspension of trust hit me the worst during the 11 m jump.

After abseiling, our group reaches a cliff, with a bit of rock jutting out. When it is my turn, I clarify and double check where I am supposed run, where I am supposed to jump, pacing from the starting point to the cliff multiple times. I muster up some mental energy, and think of Theo and Ed who just jumped before me. 

<h3>Finally, I think I'm ready.</h3>

I walk back, until I hit the tree, and I start jogging towards the edge.

1, 2, 3 steps, 4 steps, 5, 6, and then....I stop.

<h3>My feet halt a few inches before my jump, and I turn around.</h3>
<center><i>Shit.</i></center>

Banana puts down his camera with a concerned look on his face, encouraging, almost emphatic as he approaches me.

<center><i>"Be strong! If you no strong, don't jump. Be mentally strong. Strong!"</i></center>

And then I get it.

What I soon realize is that the <b>jump is not about the physical jump at all</b>. Rather, it is a battle with your mind, and winning it requires you to first stop focusing on the physical, and tackle insecurity head on.

<h3>You become what you think you are.</h3>

If you commit, if you think and tell yourself you're going to clear the rocks until you believe it, you will. If you're scared or hesitant, you won't. Like bungee jumping, canyoning takes a bit of faith. Unlike bungee jumping, a jump like this also requires self assurance. 

We were all physically capable of clearing the 1 m of rocks.

<h3>The <i>only</i> difference between those who attempted the jump and those who didn't, was mindset.</h3>

That thought really stuck with me, especially when I think of all the times we are the <b>only</b> things that hold ourselves back. 

With that, I walk back to the tree again, this time with a whole new approach. I fixate at the water in front of me and think.

<h3>I am strong. I am jumping. And yeah. I'm making it.</h3>
