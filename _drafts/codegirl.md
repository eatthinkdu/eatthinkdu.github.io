<h3>Team United Smart Girls. Eliminated.<br>Team iFrench. Advances.<br>Team Tech Voca. Eliminated.</h3>

Girls are crying. Girls are squealing. Girls are looking blankly at an announcer on a laptop screen as she calls out the team names that made the seminfinals. The piano background music starts resembling the new Adele single, as we, the audience, witness the eliminated teams heartbreak.

After a brief overview of the judging critieria, the camera quickly pans to lush green grass, a new england style brick church, a banner reading "Phillips Academy," and 4 teens in shiny Macbooks, sporting the latest iPhone. Of course, they have advanced onto the semifinals.

"I got like 5 texts in a row."

"Yeah, when there's, like, 3 texts in a row, that usually means bad news, but when there's 20 that means, like, someone's excited."

<h3>Face palm. Seriously. Like I actually had a physical reaction to this scene, and it consisted of a mixture of my hand hitting my face with the words "oh god" being vocalized.</h3>

Last week, Codecademy held a company screening of <b>CODEGIRL</b>, a new documentary intended to inpire girls to learn how to code. As a female engineer in a male-dominated profession, as well as someone passionate about helping other people learn how to code, this was right up my alley. Especially since I've seen gender dynamics play out in a couple of my past work environments, as well as in my students.

<b>CODEGIRL</b> is centered around the Technovation Challenge, a mobile app and pitch competition for high school girls. It's produced by Lesley Chilton, the same woman known for producing An Inconvenient Truth and Waiting for Superman -- two documentaries I loved.

The film's mission is noble: inspire girls, especially high school girls, to code. Feature girls like them creating apps that address real community issues, solving problems through technology. 

However, whether intentional or accidental, I found the director's not-so-subtle commentary about the purposeless of first world technology to be overwhelming. It truly is frustrating seeing solutions that could solve real problems like domestic violence awareness, water quality, and volunteer efforts get edged out by an app that is trying to fight social media depression with even more social media, because one team clearly has access to more resources than another -- I'm talking through money, technology, education, parental involvement, background, upbringing. 

Watching this film didn't leave me feeling inspired as it did disappointed as to how non-technical people might be viewing tech startups: an opportunity for entrepreneurs, rather than engineers. What happened to building impactful things that can change the world? That can <i>actually change the world</i> and solve something people are suffering with every day? Is this the direction technology is moving towards?

I'm excited people are learning how to code. I'm excited other people are excited about learning how to code. I truly believe coding is the new literacy, and that the internet revolutionized coding like the printing press did for literacy.

<h3>But coding isn't just a way to create a company dammit.</h3>
