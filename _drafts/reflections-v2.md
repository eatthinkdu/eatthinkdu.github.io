<h3 class="section-heading">Experience</h3>
<h3>How long can you step out of your comfort zone?</h3>

A couple of seconds to ask a cute guy out and risking rejection? A couple of minutes jumping out of a plane to face your fear of heights? A month learning how to code as a humanities major, even though it's "not your thing"?

I came to Cape Town to "try on" a different lifestyle. One that I never had the chance to, one in which I said "Yes" instead of "No", one in which I lived like <i>every single day</i> was my birthday.

I put myself in uncomfortable situations, and heard myself saying "This isn't my life", "This isn't real" over and over again. Everything felt so temporary.


<h3 class="section-heading">Learn</h3>
<h3>A common principle in software engineering, is that you should assume you won't get things right the first time.</h3>

Assume you've built things perfectly the first time, and run into a world of pain when the first bug arises. Expect mistakes, and you'll be that much more flexible when finding solutions to making your product better.

<h3>Why are we so much less forgiving to people, arguably the most important things in our lives?</h3>

In Cape Town, more than anything, I learned about the importance of second chances, in giving them and in receiving them.
