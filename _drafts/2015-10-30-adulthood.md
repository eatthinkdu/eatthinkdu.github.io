<h3 class="section-heading">Returning to America has made it very clear to me, that I am not yet an "adult."</h3>

I suppose I have delayed the inevitable for a glorious amount of time. I did what any self-respecting, future-fearing, wander-lusting, determined slash ambitious but confused MIT grad would do. 

Grad school. Followed by an epic eat-pray-love-but-no-i-was-not-finding-myself trip abroad.

But, after observing the majority of my friends, and listening to various comments by <strike>judgemental</strike> relatives, I've deduced that, there is hope for me yet, I'm on track, and that the path to adulthood is comprised of a few pillars.

<h3>1. Have an adult job.</h3>
Absolutely crucial to entering the real world. An adult job is something that you might have to explain to others because it sounds complicated. An adult job is usually hard to obtain when the economy is not so hot, and requires some sort of university degree. The more technical it sounds, the more adult you sound. Most importantly, an adult job is the beginning of a "career."

<h3>2. Have your own room in an apartment or house that you pay your own rent for.</h3>

The key to this is the number and type of roommates you have. You can live with at most 3 other roommates, but the fewer the roommates, the more adult you are. Roommates who were not in the same college fraternity or sorority as you are also considered more adult. Parents and/or guardians do not qualify as roommates. 

If you live in the city, bonus points for a concierge desk, a breathtaking rooftop view, and an elevator that automatically schedules floors. 

<h3>3. Wear sweaters and plain-colored pants. Not skinny jeans or leggings. Actual pants. Or at least own them.</h3>



<h3>4. Pay attention to details. Like eyebrows. And sweater fuzz.</h3>

<h3>5. Have a long-term significant other. Bonus points for a dog serving as a proxy child.</h3>
