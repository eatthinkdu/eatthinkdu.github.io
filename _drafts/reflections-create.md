<h3 class="section-heading">Create</h3>
As an engineer, I build stuff. Mostly online stuff, sometimes some physical stuff, but nonetheless, lots and lots of stuff. <i>Creating</i> is what I do for a living, what I do for fun, what I live eat breathe.

This summer, my most valuable, loved creations were not exercises, were not workshops, were not web apps.

<h3>They were the relationships I built.</h3>

They were the <b>strangers</b> that became my <b>students</b> that became my <b>friends</b>...

<h3>...that became my family.</h3>

Because at the end of the day, to echo my legendary bru Richard Lin:

<h3>"It wasn't the place, but the people."</h3>
