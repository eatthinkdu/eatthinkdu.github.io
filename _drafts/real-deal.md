<h3 class="section-heading">Listen.</h3>

This ain't going to be reality lite, so brace yourself for the real deal, not just the parts that are plucked to be shared on social media, already strained through like-maximizing filters. 

Some of you might not like what I have to say. 

Don't get me wrong, I am grateful and happy to have had the opportunity to live in Cape Town at Once for 3 months, and to work at iXperience.

<h3>Because bru, did I have the adventure of a lifetime.</h3>

I <a href="{% post_url 2015-06-28-a-216m-leap-of-faith %}" target="_blank">bungee jumped</a> off a 216 m bridge, and dove in a cage with <a href="{% post_url 2015-06-07-unreal-reality %}" target="_blank">great white sharks</a>. I pet not one, but two <a href="{% post_url 2015-06-29-garden-route %}" target="_blank">cheetahs</a> simultaneously. I rode an ostrich until I fell off, and an elephant until the sun set. I took selfies with penguins at the end of the world, and got amazing photos taken of me hanging on a sandboard against blue skies and white sand dunes. I was beaten down by waves again and again, until I stood up on a surfboard, and beat down drinks again and again until I couldn't stand. I <a href="{% post_url 2015-08-01-hikes %}" target="_blank">hiked</a> mountains to happen upon lakes, and ran alongside the ocean to get a glimpse of the mountains. We chased every sunset we could, in as many different viewpoints as we could, because we knew it wouldn't disappoint. I lived everyday like it was my birthday, and treated everyday like it would soon be a memory anyway.

I had fun like I had never had before, at an <a href="{% post_url 2015-05-27-i-landed-in-cape-town %}" target="_blank">intensity</a> that rivaled the amount of work I did at MIT, but compacted into months, not years.

Along with an awesome teaching staff, I helped 73 students learn how to code in a matter of months, and helped them web apps that tackled problems from food waste all the way to education. 

<h3>But Jesus, did I struggle like I have never before.</h3>

I struggled because I was trying on this new lifestyle, and didn't quite feel like myself for the longest time. I was out of my comfort zone, really out of it.

I had trouble dealing with people at work. Early on, I thought about quitting often. At times I felt exploited, like I wasn't valued, almost like I was dumb for even deciding to come work in Cape Town, like iX had found the wrong person to TA. It was really hard for me to stay professional and communicate how I felt, it was even harder for me to figure out who to trust. Because the nature of the job was more like a summer camp than a teaching role, I felt my work life being judged by the choices I made in my personal life.

I sometimes felt stuck.

There was plenty of social drama the first couple of months, which felt like I was living in a reality TV show, complete with my own plot line.

<h3>Growth and growing pains go hand in hand.</h3>
I learned an incredible amount about completely unexpected things.

About the importance giving and receiving second chances, about taking chances on people, and most importantly, about the incredible power of having someone see you for <b>who you could be</b>, and not for who you currently are. 

About recognizing my own value and not shying away from it, about standing up for myself, about letting things go.

<h3>But above all, it was the students who really made my experience.</h3>

So this one's for <b>them</b>.

The once <b>strangers</b>, who flew across the world to be <b>students</b>, who I eventually called my <b>friends</b>, who soon became my <b>family</b>.

<b>To Session 1 (session fun):</b> Thank you for the most badass birthday parties I've ever had and the most obscene stories I'll ever tell, for helping me say "yes" and living in the moment, if only for a moment.

<b>To Session 2 (session bru):</b> Thank you for peeling back the layers of the onion, for sharing your life stories with me

<b>To Session 3 (session me):</b>
