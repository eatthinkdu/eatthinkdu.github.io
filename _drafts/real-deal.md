<h3 class="section-heading">Don't get me wrong.</h3>

I am so grateful and happy to have had the opportunity to live in Cape Town at Once for 3 months, and to work at iXperience.

<h3>Because bru, did I have the <i>adventure</i> of a lifetime.</h3>

I <a href="{% post_url 2015-06-28-a-216m-leap-of-faith %}" target="_blank">bungee jumped</a> off a 216 m bridge, and dove in a cage with <a href="{% post_url 2015-06-07-unreal-reality %}" target="_blank">great white sharks</a>. I pet not one, but two <a href="{% post_url 2015-06-29-garden-route %}" target="_blank">cheetahs</a> simultaneously. I rode an ostrich until I fell off, and an elephant until the sun set. I took selfies with penguins at the end of the world, and got amazing photos taken of me hanging on a sandboard against blue skies and white sand dunes. I was beaten down by waves again and again, until I stood up on a surfboard, and beat down drinks again and again until I couldn't stand. I <a href="{% post_url 2015-08-01-hikes %}" target="_blank">hiked</a> mountains to happen upon lakes, and ran alongside the ocean to get a glimpse of the mountains. We chased every sunset we could, in as many different viewpoints as we could, because we knew it wouldn't disappoint. I lived everyday like it was my birthday, and treated everyday like it would soon be a memory anyway.

Along with an awesome teaching staff, I helped 73 students learn how to code in a matter of months, and helped them build beautiful, functional web apps that tackled problems from food waste all the way to education. 

<h3>But Jesus, did I <i>struggle</i> like I have never before.</h3>
I had trouble dealing with work, not the work itself, but the conditions. Early on, I thought about quitting. At times I felt taken advantage of, almost dumb for even deciding to come work for iX, like they had found the wrong person to TA. It was really hard for me to stay professional, it was even harder for me to communicate how I felt. 

My professional life and personal life melded together into this goopy mess, as I lived with, worked with, and partied with the same group of people. 

I sometimes felt stuck.

There was plenty of social drama the first couple of months, which felt like I was living in a reality TV show, complete with my own plot line.

<h3>Growth and growing pains go hand in hand.</h3>
And through it, I learned an incredible amount about completely unexpected things.

About recognizing my own value and not shying away from it, about standing up for myself, about letting things go.

About how to admit when you're wrong, forgiving other people, and most difficult of all, how to forgive myself.

About the importance of giving and receiving second chances, about taking chances on people, and most importantly, about the incredible power of having someone see you for <b>who you could be</b>, and not for who you currently are.
