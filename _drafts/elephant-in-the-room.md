<h3 class="section-heading">I've been struggling to find the right words.</h3>

I'm scared to say something offensive, or straight up wrong. Of maybe saying something that's too real or too soon. I don't want to seem ignorant or arrogant, coming from a country that is known to be both. Because at the end of the day, I can only comment on what I have seen and what I have been told, and both of those knowledge banks are extremely limited.

A lot of my posts have been light hearted topics -- bungee jumping, wine tours, feel-good adventures as demonstrated through filtered photos.
