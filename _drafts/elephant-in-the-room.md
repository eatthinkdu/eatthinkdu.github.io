<h3 class="section-heading">In Cape Town, it sometimes feels like I've been time warped back to pre-civil rights era America.</h3>

Taken back to a place and time when women and black people, maybe even unintentionally, were treated as inferior.

<h3>And I've been struggling a lot to put how I feel into words.</h3>

Maybe it's a bit of fear. Scared to say something offensive, or straight up wrong. I don't want to seem ignorant or arrogant, coming from a country that is known to be both. Because at the end of the day, I can only comment on what I have seen and what I have been told, and both of those knowledge banks are extremely limited.

<h3>As people, we are the sum of our memories and experiences and personality.</h3>

I believe that nations, too, are the sum of memories and experiences and people, that there is a cycle consisted of history shaping culture, customs, people, and vice versa.

Taking into account that apartheid was a mere 20 years ago in South Africa, seeing racial relations at play here has been really hard to take in. It's not a feeling that hits you when you get off the plane, but one that seeps in the longer you stay, and cannot be shaken afterwards.

<h3>There is <i>a lot</i> of separation in the Cape Town community.</h3>

South Africa calls itself "the Rainbox Nation" because of it's diversity. But just like each of the colors belongs to it's only lane, so do people of different races run in separate social circles. Bars that see races intermingling are few and far between.
