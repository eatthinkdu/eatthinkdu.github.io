<h3 class="section-heading">As people, we are the sum of our memories and experiences.</h3>

I believe that nations, too, are the sum of memories and experiences, that there is a cycle consisted of history shaping culture, customs, people, and vice versa.

Because apartheid was a mere 20 years ago in South Africa, seeing racial relations at play here has been really hard to take in.

<h3>I've been struggling a lot to put how I feel into words.</h3>

Almost scared. Scared to say something offensive, or straight up wrong. I don't want to seem ignorant or arrogant, coming from a country that is known to be both. Because at the end of the day, I can only comment on what I have seen and what I have been told, and both of those knowledge banks are extremely limited.
