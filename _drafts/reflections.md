<h3 class="section-heading">Compared to the rest of your life, 3 months is really insignificant.</h3>

At age 22, 3 months is just barely over 1% of my life thus far.

Even if you cut out the first 10 years, in which I was essentially an overgrown baby with an underdeveloped personality, 3 months is barely breaking 2%. That's a penny compared to a dollar, 1 single second compared to nearly 2 minutes, really just a tiny speck in a <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_blank">spoonful of diamonds</a>.

<h3>At iXperience, "growth" is valued more than just the amount time put in.</h3>

The "pillars of growth" are written on the wall just as you walk into the house to remind students of why they were there: three words I looked at many times a day, almost everyday, for 12 weeks.

<h3>What no one will remember to tell you, is that surefire signs of growth are growing pains.</h3>

People don't like to talk about pain. I don't like to talk about pain. Pain hurts. I guess that's in the very definition. 

But just like when <a href="{% post_url 2015-06-28-a-216m-leap-of-faith %}" target="_blank">faith follows fear</a>, with pain comes growth, and the students that struggled the most, maybe even cried, but kept pushing, were the ones that I saw leave the program with a new sense of accomplishment and the view that they had a newfound <b>power</b>, the power to confront and defeat a new demon as it rears its head.

<h3>I did not come out unscathed.</h3>

I often thought about quitting. I burned a few people in the process. I spent a bit of time climbing up, what some would refer to as, a hole. And so, because I like things that come full circle, and because those were the first three words I took with me when I first arrived in Cape Town, it only seems fitting that I reflect on my time in Cape Town through those three lenses.

<h3 class="section-heading">Experience</h3>
<h3>How long can you step out of your comfort zone?</h3>

A couple of seconds to ask a cute guy out and risking rejection? A couple of minutes jumping out of a plane to face your fear of heights? A month learning how to code as a humanities major, even though it's "not your thing"?

I came to Cape Town to "try on" a different lifestyle. One that I never had the chance to, one in which I said "Yes" instead of "No", one in which I lived like <i>every single day</i> was my birthday.

I put myself in uncomfortable situations, and heard myself saying "This isn't my life", "This isn't real" over and over again. Everything felt so temporary.


<h3 class="section-heading">Learn</h3>
<h3>A common principle in software engineering, is that you should assume you won't get things right the first time.</h3>

Assume you've built things perfectly the first time, and run into a world of pain when the first bug arises. Expect mistakes, and you'll be that much more flexible when finding solutions to making your product better.

<h3 class="section-heading">Create</h3>
As an engineer, I build stuff. Mostly online stuff, sometimes some physical stuff, but nonetheless, lots and lots of stuff. <i>Creating</i> is what I do for a living, what I do for fun, what I live eat breathe.

This summer, my most valuable, loved creations were not exercises, were not workshops, were not web apps.

<h3>They were the relationships I built.</h3>

They were the <b>strangers</b> that became my <b>students</b> that became my <b>friends</b>...

<h3>...that became my family.</h3>

Because at the end of the day, to echo my legendary bru Richard Lin:

<h3>"It wasn't the place, but the people."</h3>
