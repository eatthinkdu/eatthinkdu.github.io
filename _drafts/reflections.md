<h3>I didn't fall in love with Cape Town.</h3>

The separation and <a href="{% post_url 2015-08-14-elephant-in-the-room %}" target="_blank">racism</a> I saw and heard about affected me. It was hard for me to feel safe, especially after people got mugged steps away from where I worked, and got items stolen in our own hostel.

<h3>As cliche as it sounds, what made my experience incredible was not the work, not the city, but the people I met.</h3>

A Zulu Queen. A Iowa boy turned technology educator. A new programmer barely older than me but who has lived a thousand lives. These were the people who pushed me towards a version of myself I knew I could be, and weren't afraid to tell me straight when I was fucking up.

A bunch of <b>strangers</b>, who came from all over the world to be <b>students</b>, who I soon called my <b>friends</b>, who slowly became my <b>family</b>. 

To Session 1 (session fun), thank you for the most badass birthday parties I've ever had and the most obscene stories I'll ever tell, for helping me say "yes" and living in the moment, if only for a moment. You guys absolutely destroyed my liver. I'm proud to say that I'm now on week 2 of my detox.

To Session 2 (session bru), thank you for peeling back the layers of the onion, for sharing your life stories with me, for being genuine, seeing through bullshit, and calling me out on mine. Our late night talks and brews with brus are easily some of my best and most meaningful memories from Cape Town. 

To Session 3 (session me), thank you for always seeing me for my best and never losing faith in me, even when I was feeling at my worst. Your guys' over-the-top enthusiasm and quirky spirit kept me going through the last month, and I'm genuinely bummed I only had half the time with you guys.
