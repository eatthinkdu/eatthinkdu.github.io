<h3 class="section-heading">Compared to the rest of your life, 3 months is really insignificant.</h3>

At age 22, 3 months is just barely over 1% of my life thus far.

Even if you cut out the first 10 years, in which I was essentially an overgrown baby with an underdeveloped personality, 3 months is barely breaking 2%. That's a penny compared to a dollar, 1 single second compared to nearly 2 minutes, really just a tiny speck in a <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_blank">spoonful of diamonds</a>.

<h3>At iXperience, "growth" is valued more than just the amount time put in.</h3>

The "pillars of growth" are written on the wall just as you walk into the house to remind students of why they were there: three words I looked at many times a day, almost everyday, for 12 weeks.

<h3>What no one will remember to tell you, is that surefire signs of growth are growing pains.</h3>

People don't like to talk about pain. I don't like to talk about pain. Pain hurts. I guess that's in the very definition. 

But just like when <a href="{% post_url 2015-06-28-a-216m-leap-of-faith %}" target="_blank">faith follows fear</a>, with pain comes growth, and the students that struggled the most, maybe even cried, but kept pushing, were the ones that I saw leave the program with a new sense of accomplishment and the view that they had a newfound <b>power</b>, the power to confront and defeat a new demon as it rears its head.

<h3>I did not come out unscathed.</h3>

I often thought about quitting. I burned a few people in the process. I spent a bit of time climbing up, what some would refer to as, a hole. And so, because I like things that come full circle, and because those were the first three words I took with me when I first arrived in Cape Town, it only seems fitting that I reflect on my time in Cape Town through those three lenses.
