				<h3 class="section-heading">Cambodia</h3>
<p><b>Time spent:</b> 1 week<br />
<b>Suggested time:</b> 1.5-2 weeks<br />
<b>How to Get Around:</b> Use <u>buses</u> to get between cities. The most reliable bus internally is Giant Ibis. I also used Mekong Express to get to/from Vietnam. Pro-tip: if you’re short on time and don’t mind a perfect night’s sleep, overnight buses are not that sketchy. Make sure you see which bed seat they book you if you’re going alone though, some buses are weird and have double beds, and you don’t want to be next to some rando. Use <u>tuk tuks</u> to get around within a city, and be sure to bargain rates!!<br />
<b>Food:</b> Need to go to night market in Phnom Penh. Eat the Fish Amok!! Also try the Kari/Khmer noodles.</p>
<h3>[Cities I Went]</h3>
<h4>Phnom Penh:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><u>Thoughts</u>: must go. If you're short on time, spend a half day to a day here (I spent half a day and that was enough). </li>
  <li><u>What to do</u>: I saw the Killing Fields (sad, worth it, do some pre-reading before visiting, I read <i>First They Killed My Father</i> and thought taht was useful), and S21, the Genocide Museum (less impactful, but also worth it. Bring a student ID to get in for free.)</li>
  <li><u>Where I Stayed</u>: Mad Monkey Phnom Penh. Fun party type hostel. More beer pong than I've ever played in my life. Avoid if you want a good night's sleep and are not ok with meeting gap yah brits.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Siem Reap:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><u>Thoughts</u>: best city I visited in Cambodia solely due to angkor wat. I spent 3 days there and that was enough. You could probably do 2.</li>
  <li><u>What to do</u>: Angkor Wat (plus all the other temples, including the smaller ones) - get a 3 day pass if you're into old shit, get a 1 day pass if you're going to say you went to Angkor Wat or if you're short on time. Get a tour guide so you know what's going on, and go at sunrise. Getting a 3 day pass is nice because you're going to be exhausted at like 11 am and then you can go back on subsequent days to see the smaller temples (which are way cool!). ATV sunset tour through the rice paddies is also worth it.</li>
  <li><u>Where I stayed</u>: Mad Monkey Siem Reap. Again, party type hostel but with a pool. Did not like it here.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sihanhoukville:</h4>
<ul><li><u>Thoughts</u>: honestly this place sucked and you should avoid at all costs. I spent 1 night and that was 1 night wasted. There's nothing to do here except drink, and the drinking is not that fun.</li></ul>
<h4>Koh Rong:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><u>Thoughts</u>: idyllic island, cool if you want to properly beach bum. less developed than Thai islands, it's backpacker's paradise. You can easily get stuck here and not want to leave.</li>
  <li><u>What to do</u>: I chilled on the main beach for 2 days and it was glorious. This island also knows how to party, and the Cambodians will come out and join you. It's awesome.</li>
  <li><u>Where I stayed</u>: Three Brothers? I honestly don't remember but I got a private room for like $3 or something ridiculous. Monkey Island has nice bungalows though.</li>
</ul>

<h4>[Places I Wish I Went]</h4>
<ul>
  <li><u>Kampot</u>: lazy city on the river, supposed to be beautiful and a bit more authentic. was told to stay at arcadia.</li>
  <li><u>Battambang</u>: was also told this was a bit more authentic</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-heading">Vietnam</h3>
<p><b>Time spent:</b> 3 weeks<br />
<b>Suggested time:</b> 4 weeks (that’s how long you get on your visa)<br />
<b>Transportation:</b> <u>Sleeper buses</u> in Vietnam are awesome. Do not get the hop on/hop off bus deal, it’s not worth it and it decreases flexibility. Plus the companies they put you with have varying degrees of sketchiness. Try to either motorbike or take the train through Hai Van Pass! That’s the only place I would recommend not busing. Within a city, <u>taxis</u> are actually really cheap if you can split with others. Otherwise, motorbikes are the way to go.<br />
<b>Food:</b> Banh mi, you should be paying 10.000-20.000 for it, 30.000 - 60.000 for pho. Would also recommend banh xeo (egg/bean sprout/seafood crepe pancake).<br /></p>
<h3>[Cities I Went]</h3>
<h4>Saigon</h4>
<ul>
  <li><u>Thoughts</u>: just a crazy introduction to Vietnam, so many people and bustling all the time. amazing for street food, you can get awesome food at awesome prices, very easily.</li>
  <li><u>What to Do</u>: the War Remnants Museum is a must see for Americans! I didn't go see the Cu Chi Tunnels, no regrets. Just walk around and get a feel for the city.</li>
  <li><u>Where I Stayed</u>: Hideout Hostel, I think it was $8 for a 6 bed dorm and 2 free beers between 7-8 pm. Awesome place to meet people, bar crawl is meh but the people here are fun and friendly. Located in backpacker's district.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Dalat</h4>
<ul>
  <li><u>Thoughts</u>: </li>
  <li><u>What to Do</u>: </li>
  <li><u>Where I Stayed</u>: </li>
</ul>
