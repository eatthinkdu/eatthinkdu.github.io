				<h3 class="section-heading">What is your biggest fear?</h3>

<p>Is it dying? Is death the worst thing that can happen to you?</p>

<p>To be completely honest, I can think of a few things that scare me <em>more</em> than death. Losing all your memories and your personality. Losing your mind. Being in a coma and not being able to wake up.</p>

<p>I’m not saying I don’t fear death because I do. And heights. Rejection. Loneliness. Failure. I would be lying if I said these things don’t scare me because they <i>absolutely</i> do.</p>

<h3>Maybe they even scare you too.</h3>

<p>One of the things that I’m trying to do with my time off is to face my fears. Usually this leads to me doing questionable or stupid shit, but I think that comes with taking risks.</p>

<p>I don’t think you ever get rid of fear, nor would you want to. That pit in your gut, that flutter in your stomach – those are instincts that keep you alive. It’s not so much about “overcoming” your fears as much as it is about doing despite them, continuing through those moments of uncertainty, the blanched face, the almost-shitting-your-pants, about-to-scream-oh-wait-already-screaming moments.</p>

<p>Fear is 100% about admitting that you are 100% not ok, so that courage can be the leap of faith that follows. And that faith is the most incredible feeling.</p>

<h3>I took a literal leap of faith today.</h3>

<p>A 216m leap to be exact.</p>

<p>Our group woke up at 7 am to make our 9 am bungee reseravation, and the minute I got off the bus, a hoard of conflicting thoughts were already racing through my brain.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to die.” 
“But I won’t.”
“Trust engineering.”
“Except for those times when engineers fucked up, that’s no good.”
“But wait, this is going to be incredible.”</p>

<p>To be completely honest, walking from the base to the middle of the bridge was already terrifying. I was walking so slowly I actually apologized to my friend behind me.</p>

<p>You’re up on that ledge, standing, looking over and you just see for miles. In all directions. Including down. Ok so that’s a stretch, but at that moment, you are completely preoccupied with what is happening below, and you can’t help but realize that it’s all trees, valley, which translates to no cushioning if something goes awry.</p>

<p>The staff gave me a quick countdown: “3, 2, 1, bungee!” My feet pushed off and I tried to throw my body as far horizontally as I could.</p>

<h3>For 2 seconds, my life seemed over.</h3>

<p>Stomach drops head rush lungs yelling screaming. Well that was dumb. You become instantly aware of how fragile we all are and for a split second you think you’ve made a huge mistake jumping off that bridge because yes you’re going to die.</p>

<p>But just as soon as it starts, it’s over. And just as the screaming ends, an amazing rush also takes over and doesn’t let go of you.</p>

<h3> The rush is indescribable.</h3>

<p>And I’m going to do a bad job at explaining it. It’s like a combination of your brain exploding in the best way, having all your senses filled up all at once, and your internal organs having a dance party inside of you.</p>

<h3>And you are fucking flying.</h3>

<p>The laughter started quickly after the jump and didn’t let go of me. I’m not even sure where it stemmed from. But it’s an uncontrollable laughter, laughing because you cheated death and gravity, and because your body doesn’t know how to react besides being thankful that you are safe, so it bursts into a fit of undeniable happiness.</p>

<h3>I was just so grateful to be alive.</h3>
<p>Completely amped on life, ready to go out, take on the world, feeling invincible. Best natural high I’ve felt in my life.</p>

<h3>It's strange to think that all these things were made possible by fear.</h3>

<p>Not the absence of fear, but the complete presence of fear, and having the complete faith to confront it.</p>
