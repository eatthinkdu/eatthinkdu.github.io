        <title>A Breakup Letter to MIT</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Dear MIT,&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not you, it’s me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first met, I was nothing short of dazzled. I became enamored by the fast pace of living, thinking, and doing. Constantly moving, never stopping, we took on the world. A bigger, more exciting world than that small Minnesota town I left behind for you. You flew me across nations, introduced me to some of my closest friends, exposed me to my deepest passions, challenged me to beyond what I thought was my breaking point. You taught me to keep on my toes, to step out of my comfort zone. I tried every and any new experience I could get my hands on: sabar, lacrosse, ceramics, traveling, a sorority, teaching. I was exhausted, overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I thought even that wasn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after 5 years, I’ve grown tired. I’ve grown up. But most of all, I’ve outgrown you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because sometimes I think, it’s not me, it’s you. Were we ever right for each other? You are so so so needy. Demanding. Often unforgiving, even though you’re “working on it.” You have a knack for taking over lives and spirits and breaking them down so far until it’s hard to find the pieces to put back together. And like I’ve always said, you have always had a way of bringing out the absolute best in me…while simultaneously encouraging the worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I grew to love you. All the quirks, all the flaws, all the inconsistencies. The late nights, the early mornings. And I will miss all of it. Even the parts that hurt the most because those are the parts that have pushed me to grow more than I could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess this is the end. This is the end to an adventure of a lifetime, to an insurmountable number of memories, to the most amount of personal and academic growth I have ever underwent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I guess this is also the beginning. The beginning of me, just me, a me without MIT, a time to make my own way, and I’m not looking back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I am so looking forward to what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Love always,&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Erica&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ps. Don’t call me asking for money I don’t have any because of all the debt I have from paying for you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman&#39;s earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there&#39;s no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That&#39;s how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
