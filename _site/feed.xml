        <title>You in Southeast Asia</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Cambodia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time spent:&lt;/b&gt; 1 week&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Suggested time:&lt;/b&gt; 1.5-2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How to Get Around:&lt;/b&gt; Use &lt;u&gt;buses&lt;/u&gt; to get between cities. The most reliable bus internally is Giant Ibis. I also used Mekong Express to get to/from Vietnam. Pro-tip: if you’re short on time and don’t mind a perfect night’s sleep, overnight buses are not that sketchy. Make sure you see which bed seat they book you if you’re going alone though, some buses are weird and have double beds, and you don’t want to be next to some rando. Use &lt;u&gt;tuk tuks&lt;/u&gt; to get around within a city, and be sure to bargain rates!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Food:&lt;/b&gt; Need to go to night market in Phnom Penh. Eat the Fish Amok!! Also try the Kari/Khmer noodles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;[Cities I Went]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Phnom Penh:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thoughts&lt;/u&gt;: must go. If you&#39;re short on time, spend a half day to a day here (I spent half a day and that was enough). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;What to do&lt;/u&gt;: I saw the Killing Fields (sad, worth it, do some pre-reading before visiting, I read &lt;i&gt;First They Killed My Father&lt;/i&gt; and thought taht was useful), and S21, the Genocide Museum (less impactful, but also worth it. Bring a student ID to get in for free.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where I Stayed&lt;/u&gt;: Mad Monkey Phnom Penh. Fun party type hostel. More beer pong than I&#39;ve ever played in my life. Avoid if you want a good night&#39;s sleep and are not ok with meeting gap yah brits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Siem Reap:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thoughts&lt;/u&gt;: best city I visited in Cambodia solely due to angkor wat. I spent 3 days there and that was enough. You could probably do 2.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;What to do&lt;/u&gt;: Angkor Wat (plus all the other temples, including the smaller ones) - get a 3 day pass if you&#39;re into old shit, get a 1 day pass if you&#39;re going to say you went to Angkor Wat or if you&#39;re short on time. Get a tour guide so you know what&#39;s going on, and go at sunrise. Getting a 3 day pass is nice because you&#39;re going to be exhausted at like 11 am and then you can go back on subsequent days to see the smaller temples (which are way cool!). ATV sunset tour through the rice paddies is also worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where I stayed&lt;/u&gt;: Mad Monkey Siem Reap. Again, party type hostel but with a pool. Did not like it here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sihanhoukville:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thoughts&lt;/u&gt;: honestly this place sucked and you should avoid at all costs. I spent 1 night and that was 1 night wasted. There&#39;s nothing to do here except drink, and the drinking is not that fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Koh Rong:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thoughts&lt;/u&gt;: idyllic island, cool if you want to properly beach bum. less developed than Thai islands, it&#39;s backpacker&#39;s paradise. You can easily get stuck here and not want to leave.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;What to do&lt;/u&gt;: I chilled on the main beach for 2 days and it was glorious. This island also knows how to party, and the Cambodians will come out and join you. It&#39;s awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where I stayed&lt;/u&gt;: Three Brothers? I honestly don&#39;t remember but I got a private room for like $3 or something ridiculous. Monkey Island has nice bungalows though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;[Places I Wish I Went]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kampot&lt;/u&gt;: lazy city on the river, supposed to be beautiful and a bit more authentic. was told to stay at arcadia.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Battambang&lt;/u&gt;: was also told this was a bit more authentic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Vietnam&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time spent:&lt;/b&gt; 3 weeks&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Suggested time:&lt;/b&gt; 4 weeks (that’s how long you get on your visa)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Transportation:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;u&gt;Sleeper buses&lt;/u&gt; in Vietnam are awesome. Do not get the hop on/hop off bus deal, it’s not worth it and it decreases flexibility. Plus the companies they put you with have varying degrees of sketchiness. Try to either motorbike or take the train through Hai Van Pass! That’s the only place I would recommend not busing. Within a city, &lt;u&gt;taxis&lt;/u&gt; are actually really cheap if you can split with others. Otherwise, motorbikes are the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Food:&lt;/b&gt; Banh mi, you should be paying 10.000-20.000 for it, 30.000 - 60.000 for pho. Would also recommend banh xeo (egg/bean sprout/seafood crepe pancake).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;[Cities I Went]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Saigon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thoughts&lt;/u&gt;: just a crazy introduction to Vietnam, so many people and bustling all the time. amazing for street food, you can get awesome food at awesome prices, very easily.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;What to Do&lt;/u&gt;: the War Remnants Museum is a must see for Americans! I didn&#39;t go see the Cu Chi Tunnels, no regrets. Just walk around and get a feel for the city.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where I Stayed&lt;/u&gt;: Hideout Hostel, I think it was $8 for a 6 bed dorm and 2 free beers between 7-8 pm. Awesome place to meet people, bar crawl is meh but the people here are fun and friendly. Located in backpacker&#39;s district.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Dalat&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thoughts&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;What to Do&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where I Stayed&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thoughts&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;What to Do&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where I Stayed&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>You in Southeast Asia</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Coming soon!&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>You in Southeast Asia</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;First, congrats!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s still uncommon for Americans to forgo the classic “Eurotrip” for that part of the world we either learn about in history books, hear about from grandparents talking about their “time back in ‘nam,” or see from those cheesy travel instagrams that we all know are staged but not-so-secretly envy anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Second, get excited because Southeast Asia is just as fucking incredible as everyone says.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these buzzwords - “freedom,” “adventure” - that mean absolutely nothing on their own will mean something to you. They will mean having to use every language you know and some that you don’t to get back home after dark because transportation doesn’t work like they should. They will mean trusting locals more than you do google maps, and ignoring 80% of advice from books and blogs (probably including this one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Because a lot of people have been asking me, this post will cover practical advice and suggestions for those hoping or planning to go to Southeast Asia.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I will also post &lt;a href=&quot;/du/2015/12/02/itinerary/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my itinerary&lt;/a&gt; for reference.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you guys find this useful in some way, and if you do end up going to Southeast Asia, I’d love to hear about it :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Advice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Don&#39;t plan too much.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first started backpacking, I was a girl prepared. I knew where I was staying. I knew generally what there was to do in each place. I read Hostelworld reviews and Trip Advisor forums. Within a week, I stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I got to Vietnam, I would show up to a hostel on a fellow traveler’s recommendation, ask if there were any beds available and then head out to explore. I would then leave if I was 1) bored and I wanted to check out another city, 2) my visa was expiring and I had to book it out of the country 3) adjusting my travel plans to spend more time with people I met along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked travelling like this, but always knew my options so was flexible enough to choose my own destiny, but always had enough plans to not let passiveness take over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll have to find a balance for what you feel comfortable with and what works for you, but I’d challenge you to be more spontaneous than you usually are. You never know who you might meet, which cities you’ll fall in love with, where you feel like you could spend an eternity. &lt;b&gt;Don’t pre-limit yourself!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Ask like-minded travellers for advice.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be prepared to have the same conversation literally over and over again. It’s like freshman orientation in that everyone says the same facts about themselves except the stopping point is when you stop travelling. You’ll be asked where you’re from. How long you’ve been travelling. Where you’ve been. Where you’re going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take this time to ask for tips!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t follow every piece of advice you get. Figure out if you guys have similar interests/vibes and then go from there. In Vietnam, talking to lots of outdoorsy, active people led me to Dalat, Phong Nha, and Sa Pa, 3 of my favorite places in all of Southeast Asia, and caused me to skip over some other cities on the backpackers trail. In addition to asking for things to do, ask for where to stay. Again, gauge the advice based on vibe and if you like them. There are party hostels where you can play as much beer pong as your inner college frat boy desires, and there are swanky, how-is-this-only-$15 hostels for swankier folk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally liked the homestay type hostels the best, but have definitely stayed in a spectrum. It took me a while to get the hang of taking advice from the right people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Go solo.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When do you do things alone? And not like “shower” and “cook dinner.” I mean like real world things like go to a restaurant or a movie. If the answer to that is never, than you and I are in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travelling alone might not make too much sense at first. I’ve gotten a spectrum of questions. Why do you need to cross half the world to be by yourself? You can do that kind of stuff, you know, anywhere. Isn’t it scary? Didn’t you get lonely?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer those questions, 1. no, I actually never got lonely, 2. sometimes did get scared but never felt “in danger,” and 3. there’s a volume and variety of activity you experience while travelling that is so incomparable to regular life, that being by yourself is a completely different experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You gain an impressive amount of skills when travelling alone since you’re doing so many new things by yourself at such a high frequency. You have to figure out what &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; actually want on a daily basis, and actively &lt;i&gt;choose&lt;/i&gt; who to spend time with. Above all, you’ll gain an increased sense of self and confidence in your own abilities. That sense of empowerment isn’t something that disappears when you come back to America - that shit sticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. General food advice.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eat street food, but only where the locals are lining up. Good rule of thumb, if you see locals eating there, it’s good. If you see tons of locals, it’s probably really fucking good. If you see no locals, but do see tourists, it’s probably good but wayyyy overpriced. If you see literally no one, don’t eat the food. If you can’t read the sign, don’t let that stop you! Point and pay. That’s pretty universal. (pro-tip Saigon is an awesome city to just walk around and buy street food)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buy bottled water, just do it. The largest bottle you can without being obnoxious. Hostels will rip you off so try to buy everything at stores, you should be able to get a huge bottle of water for less than $1 everywhere you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raw veg is iffy. Vietnamese food has a ton of raw herbs so be careful, but you don’t necessarily need to avoid it altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the food in Sapa, Vietnam is literal shit. Not sure why. Do not get the fixed menu deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Other general advice.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep a travel journal.&lt;/b&gt; I have bits of writing here and there but met people with extensive records and was jealous. One girl I met was following her grandpa’s backpacking trip off his journal from way back when. Life goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Try to bring ca$h and not use ATMs, those fees rack up.&lt;/b&gt; In Cambodia, everyone actualy uses $1 bills, so stock up on singles. Otherwise get $100s and bring them with you to exchange money. To give a upper-bound estimate, food will run you $3-5 a meal, accommodation $5-8, $1-2/beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rent a motorbike/moped, just don’t go too crazy.&lt;/b&gt; You’ll see a lot of people get injured and bandaged, it happens. Find a place without too many bikes on the road (like an island), get someone to take time and teach you how to ride it, take a few practice laps first, and wear a helmet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pack as light as possible.&lt;/b&gt; I was working 13 kg - which included my laptop and DSLR. If anything, I would’ve invested in some good hiking shoes, walking shoes, and flip flops.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I&#39;m Not That Codegirl</title>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;Team United Smart Girls. Eliminated.&lt;br /&gt;Team iFrench. Advances.&lt;br /&gt;Team Tech Voca. Eliminated.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girls are crying. Girls are squealing. Girls are looking blankly at an announcer on a laptop screen as she calls out the team names that made the seminfinals. The piano background music starts resembling the new Adele single, as we, the audience, witness the eliminated teams heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief overview of the judging critieria, the camera quickly pans to lush green grass, a new england style brick church, a banner reading “Phillips Academy,” and 4 teens in shiny Macbooks, sporting the latest iPhone. Of course, they have advanced onto the semifinals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I got like 5 texts in a row.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, when there’s, like, 3 texts in a row, that usually means bad news, but when there’s 20 that means, like, someone’s excited.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Face palm. Seriously. Like I actually had a physical reaction to this scene, and it consisted of a mixture of my hand hitting my face with the words &quot;oh god&quot; being vocalized.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, Codecademy held a company screening of &lt;b&gt;CODEGIRL&lt;/b&gt;, a new documentary intended to inpire girls to learn how to code. As a female engineer in a male-dominated profession, as well as someone passionate about helping other people learn how to code, this was right up my alley. Especially since I’ve seen gender dynamics play out in a couple of my past work environments, as well as in my students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CODEGIRL&lt;/b&gt; is centered around the Technovation Challenge, a mobile app and pitch competition for high school girls. It’s produced by Lesley Chilton, the same woman known for producing An Inconvenient Truth and Waiting for Superman – two documentaries I loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film’s mission is noble: inspire girls, especially high school girls, to code. Feature girls like them creating apps that address real community issues, solving problems through technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, whether intentional or accidental, I found the director’s not-so-subtle commentary about the purposeless of first world technology to be overwhelming. It truly is frustrating seeing solutions that could solve real problems like domestic violence awareness, water quality, and volunteer efforts get edged out by an app that is trying to fight social media depression with even more social media, because one team clearly has access to more resources than another – I’m talking through money, technology, education, parental involvement, background, upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching this film didn’t leave me feeling inspired as it did disappointed as to how non-technical people might be viewing tech startups: an opportunity for entrepreneurs, rather than engineers. What happened to building impactful things that can change the world? That can &lt;i&gt;actually change the world&lt;/i&gt; and solve something people are suffering with every day? Is this the direction technology is moving towards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited people are learning how to code. I’m excited other people are excited about learning how to code. I truly believe coding is the new literacy, and that the internet revolutionized coding like the printing press did for literacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;But coding isn&#39;t just a way to create a company dammit.&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>How To Adult</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Returning to America has made it very clear to me, that I am not yet an &quot;adult.&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/think/adulthood/realworld.bmp&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot; style=&quot;padding:20px;display:inline-block&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose I have delayed the inevitable for a glorious amount of time. I did what any self-respecting, future-fearing, wander-lusting, determined slash ambitious but confused MIT grad would do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grad school. Followed by an epic eat-pray-love-but-no-i-was-not-finding-myself trip abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/think/adulthood/worldfun.bmp&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; style=&quot;padding:20px;display:inline-block&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/think/adulthood/book.bmp&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot; style=&quot;padding:20px;display:inline-block&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, after observing the majority of my friends, and listening to various comments by &lt;strike&gt;judgemental&lt;/strike&gt; relatives, I’ve deduced that, there is hope for me yet, I’m on track, and that the path to adulthood is comprised of a few pillars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/think/adulthood/adult.bmp&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; style=&quot;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:20px;display:inline-block&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Have an adult job.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely crucial to entering the real world. An adult job is something that you might have to explain to others because it sounds complicated. An adult job is usually hard to obtain when the economy is not so hot, and requires some sort of university degree. The more technical it sounds, the more adult you sound. Most importantly, an adult job is the beginning of a “career.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/think/adulthood/jobs.bmp&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot; style=&quot;padding:20px;display:inline-block&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Have your own room in an apartment or house that you pay your own rent for.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to this is the number and type of roommates you have. You can live with at most 3 other roommates, but the fewer the roommates, the more adult you are. Roommates who were not in the same college fraternity or sorority as you are also considered more adult. Parents and/or guardians do not qualify as roommates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you live in the city, bonus points for a concierge desk, a breathtaking rooftop view, and an elevator that automatically schedules floors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Wear sweaters and plain-colored pants. Not skinny jeans or leggings. Actual pants. Or at least own them.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Pay attention to details. Like eyebrows. And sweater fuzz.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Have a long-term significant other. Bonus points for a dog serving as a proxy child.&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>Soul Maintainence</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;I recently returned to America after close to 3 months solo backpacking in Asia.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have so much to tell and want to share, but at the same time, don’t know what to say. Going through the logistics of which countries I visited and my itinerary, coupled with some generic adjectives like “awesome” and “amazing” is my easy way out - but it just doesn’t even come close. I get stumped at the questions -  “What was your favorite part?” “What did you learn?” “Are you happy to be back?” - not because I don’t have answers, but because I don’t know where to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;This trip changed me. But not necessarily in the ways I thought it would.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did, however, come back more sure of who I want to become, more confident in who I am, and more ok with who I used to be. It taught me about the infiniteness of life, the necessity of love, the worth of people, the illusion of time. Here are a few of the most important things I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;#1. The past provides context, but doesn&#39;t need to define the future.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; experience we ever have in our lives - from the monotony we fall into from our daily routines, to drifting aimlessly ad puposelessly, to all the times we spectalularly fuck up and keep fucking up - they all make up who we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are the good, and we are the bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;#2. Meeting people is a skill that can be developed.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all the recent grads out there, we all know meeting people get considerably harder after college. No more random drunken frat parties where you become biffles with literally everone in the room because you’re wearing the same color shirt or some other dumb shit like that. But solo travelling taught me that meeting poeple is a skill, and something you can get better at just by practicing, and something worth practicing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lesson #2. Travel Erica should be real life Erica.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something about leaving the country transforms me. I’m not saying I’m a completely different person. To to a certain degree, I am way more willing to take risks, agree to do dumb shit way more frequently, and don’t hesitate to stand up for myself when things are out of line. It’s weird - why do I need to fly halfway across the world to be another version of me? Now that I’m back in NYC (and away from MIT, phew), I can feel myself bringing the same attitude and independence and courage back with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Travel Erica has never felt so at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lesson #3. The right people at the right time can change your life...if you let them.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to hate it when people said “My favorite part of [working/studying/being] here is the people.” That’s almost as bad as telling me “I love the culture.” What does that actually mean. There is nothing useful about those statements. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after meeting tens of people every week, and hundreds of people across months, I have to say that it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, I’ve met people who have challenged my beliefs, who have forced me to confront my past demons, who have cared about me in magnitudes I couldn’t comprehend, who have restored my faith in random acts of kindness bestowed upon lost strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who make you feel whole, and human, and connected. People that teach you about themselves, and then about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lesson #3. Fuck imposter syndrome.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lesson #4. Being scared is a calculated challenge. Prove yourself wrong.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;You get a strange feeling when you&#39;re about to leave a place, like you&#39;ll not only miss the people you love but you&#39;ll miss the person you are now at this time and this place, because you&#39;ll never be this way ever again.&quot; -Reading Lolita in Tehran (Azar Nafisi)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Thailand Highlights</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Compared to Vietnam and Cambodia, Thailand was shockingly easy.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost wish I started my trip here, as a more gentle introduction to the backpacking life. It surprised me how developed cities were, from infrastructure to amenities to home comforts like fast food and 711 and Oreos. Everyone spoke English (and spoke it well), activities were just laid out for travellers, street food was located at the most convenient corners, hostels were basically set up for backpackers to hang out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Although significantly more tourist-y, there was so so so much to do in Thailand.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 18 days in &lt;b&gt;no way&lt;/b&gt; did it justice. In the north of Thailand I went wilderness trekking, temple hopped, rode my scooter through valleys of unreal scenery, befriended elephants - not to mention everything was dirt cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the south of Thailand I spent days just sipping on young coconuts chillin on postcard worthy beaches, got scuba certified in sky blue waters, watched fire dancers spin at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not even mentioning Bangkok. And all that is, well, Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What colored my time in Thailand was the group of backpackers I was lucky enough to travel with for part of my trip.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over just a couple of days, our group of backpackers from Chiang Mai became a “squad.” A squad that made moving from place to place less strange, more welcoming, and always fun. A mini travel family that looked out for each other and stuck together - even when my own travel schedule was off everyone else’s by a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any family trip, yes, it took forever to mobilize and get places. Deciding on a restaurant was a true mission. But no matter what, in whichever city, we would always make the effort to spend time together. They were the people who could easily bypass the small talk and get straight to the realtalk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;So here&#39;s a shoutout to my #SQUAD. You guys made me think. You guys made me laugh. Stay gold.&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>Why You Should Backpack Alone</title>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;You meet people who will change you.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some way or another, in big ways or small ways, you’ll meet other backpackers or locals that will impact the way you view the world, the way you view life, the way you view yourself. When travelling, relationships are accelerated ten-fold, and even though the number of days you spend with certain people are small, the amount and diversity of things you’re doing together and talking about cover significant amounts of ground, getting to places where friendships in “real life” might take months to reach.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Homage to Thai Food</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;When it comes to Southeast Asian cuisine, Thailand is the clear winner, hands-down, not even a competition.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, Thailand has pretty kick-ass food. Plentiful coconut milk, palm sugar, throw in a little bit of spice and everything nice - maybe basil, garlic, tumeric. I even took a day-long cooking course in order to try my hand at some of the more popular dishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/eat/thailand/serious.JPG&quot; height=&quot;375px&quot; width=&quot;375px&quot; style=&quot;padding:20px;display:inline-block&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/eat/thailand/me.JPG&quot; height=&quot;375px&quot; width=&quot;375px&quot; style=&quot;padding:20px;display:inline-block&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:-10px;padding-bottom:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Intense focus making curry powder, followed by a successful pad thai.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/eat/thailand/spices.JPG&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; style=&quot;padding:20px;display:inline-block&quot; /&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:-10px;padding-bottom:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Basketful of goodness procured by our cooking instructor.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the same strain of flavors bringing everything together, you really can’t go wrong. Curries, pad thais, fried noodles, sticky rice, papaya salads, refreshing mango shakes. Obtained from the most unassuming of wooden stands off the side of the road, always made by adorable old Thai men and women. I could go on forever (and eat forever) but I don’t want you guys to get bored, and I also don’t want to come home obese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Photo Homage&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:-10px;padding-bottom:20px;width:600px&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Papaya Salad: crunchy with a bit of a kick, a touch of sweet, topped with roasted peanuts&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:-10px;padding-bottom:20px;width:600px&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spring Rolls: crispy, flaky, stuffed with goodness then dipped in a sweet chili sauce&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:-10px;padding-bottom:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chicken Panang Curry: no idea what&#39;s in this, but it&#39;s delicious&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:-10px;padding-bottom:20px;width:600px&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thai Iced Tea: the Vietnamese coffee of Thailand, black tea with condensed milk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:-10px;padding-bottom:20px;width:600px&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mango Sticky Rice: most genius combo known to man = mango + sticky rice + coconut milk + roasted mung bean&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Elephant Jungle Sanctuary</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;To me, elephants always seemed invincible.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re smart. They’re adorable. They’re massive yet friendly. They’re exotic. Everyone, and I mean everyone, can’t help but fall in love with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/du/thailand/elephants/smile.JPG&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot; style=&quot;padding:20px;display:inline-block&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came as a huge shock to me that the majority of elephants in Thailand are actually &lt;i&gt;suffering&lt;/i&gt; working in the tourism industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My day visiting the Elephant Jungle Sanctuary was both a fun, and eye-opening experience.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a 2 hour drive and a bit of bumpy off-roading through a jungle in our tuk-tuk red cab, the trees opened up into what I can only describe as &lt;b&gt;elephant paradise&lt;/b&gt; - lush green grass, rolling hills, a pile of corn husks, a mud pool, and a waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, along with the rest of the group, changed into traditional &lt;i&gt;mahout&lt;/i&gt; gear, a colorful rug-like t-shirt we were to wear for the rest of our time at Elephant Jungle Sanctuary, and were given a brief introduction of their mission, and also background on the plight of the Asian Elephant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/du/thailand/elephants/elephant.jpg&quot; height=&quot;375px&quot; width=&quot;375px&quot; style=&quot;padding:20px;display:inline-block&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Because of agriculture and human expansion, there is no longer room for the wild Asian elephant.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elephants in captivity have &lt;i&gt;mahouts&lt;/i&gt;, the name for elephant caretakers, but they sometimes do not give their elephants the best care out of desperation for money or just lack of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m talking broken or disfigured backs from elephant riding, emotional abuse from a young age, exhaustion from being overworked. They are chained, fenced in, poked and prodded with wooden hooks in order to follow human commands sheerly for the purpose of tourist entertainment. The oldest elephant at Elephant Jungle Sanctuary actually had a crooked back from riding years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethically responsible elephant parks, like Elephant Jungle Sanctuary and Elephant Nature Park, take in formerly abused elephants, take care of them, and allow them to roam free within the sanctuaries - without chains, hooks, or riding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/du/thailand/elephants/tree.JPG&quot; height=&quot;375px&quot; width=&quot;375px&quot; style=&quot;padding:20px;display:inline-block&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/du/thailand/elephants/closeup.JPG&quot; height=&quot;375px&quot; width=&quot;375px&quot; style=&quot;padding:20px;display:inline-block&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;We still spent the entire day interacting with elephants - but in a way that was safe and enjoyable for both the animals and for visitors.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fed the elephants bunches of bananas (they literally do not stop eating and pooping), walked with them around the grounds, played with them in the mud pits, and lastly bathed them in the waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/du/thailand/elephants/big.JPG&quot; height=&quot;375px&quot; width=&quot;375px&quot; style=&quot;padding:20px;display:inline-block&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/du/thailand/elephants/morebath.jpg&quot; width=&quot;375px&quot; style=&quot;padding:20px;display:inline-block&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of which felt more &lt;b&gt;natural&lt;/b&gt; than riding, and allowed you to get close to the massive creatures in a way that seemed &lt;b&gt;comfortable&lt;/b&gt;. Seeing how smart, friendly, and hilarious elephants are, so up close and personal was not only an incredible experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/du/thailand/elephants/baby.JPG&quot; height=&quot;375px&quot; width=&quot;336px&quot; style=&quot;padding:20px;display:inline-block&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/du/thailand/elephants/kisses.jpg&quot; width=&quot;413px&quot; style=&quot;padding:20px;display:inline-block&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;It was also a lesson on humanity, on our effect on the creatures around us, and a challenge to look a little deeper when participating in animal tourism.&lt;/h3&gt;
