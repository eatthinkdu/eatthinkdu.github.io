        <title>I Have Truly Found Paradise</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;I have truly found paradise.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not the kind of IHTFP from MIT, none of that. This past weekend we went wine tasting at a gem called Spice Route. Spice Route is basically a collection of artisan food and drink merchants situated on a beautiful farm near Stellenbosch, with awesome chocolate, wine, beer, cheese, biltong, gelato, and art. Did I mention that the chocolate was amazing. Because it was. Seriously the only thing this place is missing to become perfection is puppies. And maybe crepes. I was disappointed that I couldn’t find crepes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started out with a white and red wine tasting, paired with 5 different types of chocolate, and then moved on to beer paired with a biltong and cheese sampler. Even though it’s technically winter here in South Africa, it was really sunny, and the leaves were still falling, kind of like how it would look on a perfect fall day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a peak into my heaven on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/scenery.jpg&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; style=&quot;padding-top:20px&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    All of these things are my favorites.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

        <title>The Hard Stuff</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The first month is always hard.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day I was in Spain, I got dropped off on a random street corner, almost got kicked out of my apartment on hour 1 due to a payment misunderstanding. When jokes get repeated 10 times for a foreigner who still has no clue what’s being said, they are no longer funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first month I was in NYC, I legitimately contemplated buying a ticket out to SF for the weekend. Let’s just say that the cramped space, coupled with the undeniable episode of bedbugs drove me to cheapflights.com at 4 am in the morning many a night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would’ve guessed that those two summers turned out to be the best in my life? Somehow it happened, it always does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;So, it really didn&#39;t surprise me at all when I started to have bouts of blues here in Cape Town.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really does surprise me how &lt;i&gt;infrequently&lt;/i&gt; I feel uncomfortable here. How easy it was to build relationships and form new attachments. It almost bothers me how quickly this new &lt;i&gt;lifestyle&lt;/i&gt; has fallen into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, the first month is always hard, and these are the things I miss the most, some more serious than others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Electricity...all the time.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People. Loadshedding is a thing. For everyone not in South Africa, please look it up RIGHT NOW. This is important. This is what &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; happens. The government just turns off electricity for huge areas at a time. Why is the rest of the world not talking about this?? How is this ok?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Summer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok to be perfectly clear, I admit, “winter” here is a complete joke. 60 degree weather is spring or fall at best. Everytime some complains about the cold, I seriously want to call the wah-bulance. But as I’m finding out, without central heating, winter here does not joke around. It gets a bit nippy when the sun’s not out. Why am I wearing a jacket? It’s supposed to be June? This is not helping my self-diagnosed Seasonal Affective Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Dollars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look up the Dollar to Rand conversion rate. Realize that I am being paid in Rand. Look over at MIT degrees already gathering dust and angry emails from parents. Rinse. Repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Free Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one’s sort of a joke, since I never got free time at MIT either. But people tell me about this thing called free time, and it seems incredible. Like you get to do stuff you like that’s not work. WHOA! It sounds nice in theory yeah? Maybe one of these days I’ll figure out this whole balance thing and I’ll try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Being able to reference inside jokes from last year. Looking at your friend and knowing that something&#39;s up...and vice versa.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s just something nice about reminicising about the good old times. This one’s a shoutout to you my B5 Bros, my MIT family, and Tonka crew. Time isn’t the most important part of friendship, but does a helluva good job when it comes to staying power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even though I’m probably having the most incredible experience of my life, have met some people I genuinely call my friends…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;I really do still miss you guys. Is that too much?&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>My Unreal Reality</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;I am living an unreal reality, and I&#39;m just waiting to wake up from a dream.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boss asked me the other day, “If you could describe your experience here in Cape Town, what would it be?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&quot;What is going on, who am I?&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are coming at me a million miles a minute, a different sort of firehose, and I am saying yes to everything. I have no idea who this version of myself is, but she is way crazier than the actual Erica. She is also pretty awesome. Maybe I like it. I can’t tell yet. You be the judge – here’s a handful of things I’ve been able to do while in Cape Town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;secion-heading&quot;&gt;Shark Cage Diving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/shark.jpg&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; style=&quot;padding-top:20px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s exactly what it sounds like, I got to go diving with Great Whites my first weekend in Cape Town. What no one tells you: you wake up at 4 am in the morning, and then board a boat where 25% of the people will barf multiple times. Another 25% will feel like they could chunder at any given moment but hold back by staring at land or sucking on a lollipop. Go figure. What you probably guessed: it was a f***ing awesome experience. Sharks are beautiful. Not to mention massive. You need to do it. Would not recommend drinking the night before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;secion-heading&quot;&gt;Surfing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/surfing.jpg&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; style=&quot;padding-top:20px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, I need an experience that knocks me on the ground so I can get back up again (am I masochistic?). Surfing is exactly that. Literally, exactly that. Even though I’ve wakeboarded and snow boarded before, surfing kicked my ass, and I loved it. There is nothing cooler than standing up on top of a wave, and then getting sucked back into ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;secion-heading&quot;&gt;Sandboarding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://eatthinkdu.com/img/sand-min.jpg&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; style=&quot;padding-top:20px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I distinctly remember lying on the sand next to a friend, board in hand, thinking out loud, “Does it get any better than this?” Can’t decide what was more fun: sandboarding, running around barefoot with new friends, sliding down sand hills, holding on for life on the back of a pick up truck driving around the dunes. Current vote is for the running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;secion-heading&quot;&gt;Nightlife&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekends in Cape Town have been something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This is my new normal.&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>I landed in Cape Town</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;I am exhausted.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the type of exhausted where you’re not only physically tired, but also drained socially and mentally, enough so that not even sleep or massive amounts of coffee will cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flew to Cape Town 3 days after frantically turning in my Master’s thesis, 2 days after a farewell party to say goodbye to all my friends, 1 day after packing up all my things from 5 years in Boston and shipping said boxes to MN, and a couple of hours after packing my suitcases for my 6 months abroad. I &lt;del&gt;think&lt;/del&gt; know I have to be crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even crazier? The amount of things that have happened in such a short span of time. I don’t even have the time or energy to put all my thoughts into words right now. But I landed in Cape Town a week ago…and here’s what happened next.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Around the World in (1)80 days</title>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;All my life, I feel like I&#39;ve made the &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; choices.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked hard, got good grades, made it to MIT, and even somehow (seriously, somehow) managed to graduate in 5 years with 2 degrees with most of my sanity and dreams in tact. I always had summer internships, had the right names on my resume, opened the right doors. I got involved in the right communities, made the right choices, made the right teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;All my life, I feel like I&#39;ve made the &lt;i&gt;predictable&lt;/i&gt; choices.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed the typical Asian American dream and the life path was set out. All throughout high school, I didn&#39;t take risks, I didn&#39;t go out, I brought my calculus book to homecoming. When I got to MIT, I got lucky and fell in love with computer science. I majored in the most lucrative field of this decade from possibly the best engineering school in the world, and had a job offer from one of the largest, well-known tech companies to ever exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;But this time, I veered off the beaten path.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always wanted to take time off and see the world. One of my favorite things to do is in one place for months and melding into a community. I got a taste of it the past 4 years through MIT, getting the opportunity to intern in Spain for 3 months and teach in Israel and Italy, both for 1 month periods. I knew that if I didn&#39;t do it now, there might not be another time in my life when I have this much freedom, independence, and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;There is something about travel that is so renewing to the soul that it is hard to put into words.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, it&#39;s more than just going to a new place, absorbing the culture, seeing pretty things -- even more than meeting new people and getting to know the locals (though, I do like all of those things!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, so much of travel is about &lt;b&gt;leaping&lt;/b&gt;, not walking, out from your comfort zone, living your life unabashedly in a different rhythm to a different tune, and envisioning and stretching yourself in ways you had never imagined before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s about a mindset that always says &quot;Anything can happen&quot;, and moments where you take the risks you normally wouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s about finding who you are, changing who you are, and loving who you are in a completely new environment where you aren&#39;t distracted by everday stresses or held back familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;And that&#39;s how the grand plan was hatched.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to MISTI at MIT, I was able to make this trip a reality. I&#39;ll be out of country for a total of 6 months, starting in Cape Town, South Africa for 3 months teaching at an awesome startup called &lt;a href=&quot;http://ixperience.co.za&quot;&gt;iXperience&lt;/a&gt;, and ending in Asia. I&#39;ll be a mentor for the Service Leadership Program with the MIT China Development Initiative in Hangzhou, China at Zhejiang University in August, and then will either be working or travelling throughout China until November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;So here&#39;s to adventure.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s to breaking through barriers, breaking down boundaries, and breaking out of the boxes we put ourselves in. To late nights, new soul mates, friends to call family. To crazy nights we can&#39;t remember, bad decisions that turn into great stories, drunken toasts. To losing our breath, getting our breath taken away, cheesy quotes, chasing views, constantly learning. To food that tastes so good we wish it never existed, trying everything once, embracing and welcoming the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Above all, here&#39;s to missing home, because there&#39;s no place like it, but finding a new, unexpected one in the process.&lt;/h3&gt;
